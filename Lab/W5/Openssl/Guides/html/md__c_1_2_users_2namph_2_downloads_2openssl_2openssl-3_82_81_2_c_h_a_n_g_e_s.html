<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Changes between 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 [30 Jan 2024]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL did not correctly check for this case. A fix has been applied to prevent a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue prior to this fix.</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL APIs that were vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().</p>
<p class="startli">We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.</p>
<p class="startli">(<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2024-0727">CVE-2024-0727</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time.</p>
<p class="startli">An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.</p>
<p class="startli">The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the "-pubin" and "-check" options on untrusted data.</p>
<p class="startli">To resolve this issue RSA keys larger than OPENSSL_RSA_MAX_MODULUS_BITS will now fail the check immediately with an RSA_R_MODULUS_TOO_LARGE error reason.</p>
<p class="startli">(<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-6237">CVE-2023-6237</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Restore the encoding of SM2 PrivateKeyInfo and SubjectPublicKeyInfo to have the contained AlgorithmIdentifier.algorithm set to id-ecPublicKey rather than SM2.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs saves the contents of vector registers in different order than they are restored. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers is corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.</p>
<p class="startli">The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.</p>
<p class="startli">(<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-6129">CVE-2023-6129</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rohan McLure</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix excessive time spent in DH check / generation with large Q parameter value.</p>
<p class="startli">Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.</p>
<p class="startli">(<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-5678">CVE-2023-5678</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Disable building QUIC server utility when OpenSSL is configured with <code>no-apps</code>.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Vitalii Koshura</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Changes between 3.1 and 3.2.0 [23 Nov 2023]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">The BLAKE2b hash algorithm supports a configurable output length by setting the "size" parameter.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Čestmír Kalina and Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Enable extra Arm64 optimization on Windows for GHASH, RAND and AES.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Evgeny Karpov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added a function to delete objects from store by URI - OSSL_STORE_delete() and the corresponding provider-storemgmt API function OSSL_FUNC_store_delete().</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Dmitry Belyavskiy</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added OSSL_FUNC_store_open_ex() provider-storemgmt API function to pass a passphrase callback when opening a store.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Simo Sorce</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed the default salt length used by PBES2 KDF's (PBKDF2 and scrypt) from 8 bytes to 16 bytes. The PKCS5 (RFC 8018) standard uses a 64 bit salt length for PBE, and recommends a minimum of 64 bits for PBES2. For FIPS compliance PBKDF2 requires a salt length of 128 bits. This affects OpenSSL command line applications such as "genrsa" and "pkcs8" and API's such as PEM_write_bio_PrivateKey() that are reliant on the default value. The additional commandline option 'saltlen' has been added to the OpenSSL command line applications for "pkcs8" and "enc" to allow the salt length to be set to a non default value.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Shane Lontis</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed the default value of the <code>ess_cert_id_alg</code> configuration option which is used to calculate the TSA's public key certificate identifier. The default algorithm is updated to be sha256 instead of sha1.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Małgorzata Olszówka</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added optimization for SM2 algorithm on aarch64. It uses a huge precomputed table for point multiplication of the base point, which increases the size of libcrypto from 4.4 MB to 4.9 MB. A new configure option <code>no-sm2-precomp</code> has been added to disable the precomputed table.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Xu Yizhou</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added client side support for QUIC</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Hugo Landau, Matt Caswell, Paul Dale, Tomáš Mráz, Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added multiple tutorials on the OpenSSL library and in particular on writing various clients (using TLS and QUIC protocols) with libssl.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added secp384r1 implementation using Solinas' reduction to improve speed of the NIST P-384 elliptic curve. To enable the implementation the build option <code>enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128</code> must be used.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rohan McLure</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Improved RFC7468 compliance of the asn1parse command.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matthias St. Pierre</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added SHA256/192 algorithm support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Fergus Dall</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for securely getting root CA certificate update in CMP.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Improved contention on global write locks by using more read locks where appropriate.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Improved performance of OSSL_PARAM lookups in performance critical provider functions.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added the SSL_get0_group_name() function to provide access to the name of the group used for the TLS key exchange.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Alex Bozarth</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Provide a new configure option <code>no-http</code> that can be used to disable the HTTP support. Provide new configure options <code>no-apps</code> and <code>no-docs</code> to disable building the openssl command line application and the documentation.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Vladimír Kotal</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Provide a new configure option <code>no-ecx</code> that can be used to disable the X25519, X448, and EdDSA support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Yi Li</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">When multiple OSSL_KDF_PARAM_INFO parameters are passed to the EVP_KDF_CTX_set_params() function they are now concatenated not just for the HKDF algorithm but also for SSKDF and X9.63 KDF algorithms.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_im/export_types_ex() provider functions that get the provider context as a parameter.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ingo Franzki</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">TLS round-trip time calculation was added by a Brigham Young University Capstone team partnering with Sandia National Laboratories. A new function in ssl_lib titled SSL_get_handshake_rtt will calculate and retrieve this value.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Jairus Christensen</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added the "-quic" option to s_client to enable connectivity to QUIC servers. QUIC requires the use of ALPN, so this must be specified via the "-alpn" option. Use of the "advanced" s_client command command via the "-adv" option is recommended.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added an "advanced" command mode to s_client. Use this with the "-adv" option. The old "basic" command mode recognises certain letters that must always appear at the start of a line and cannot be escaped. The advanced command mode enables commands to be entered anywhere and there is an escaping mechanism. After starting s_client with "-adv" type "{help}" to show a list of available commands.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add Raw Public Key (RFC7250) support. Authentication is supported by matching keys against either local policy (TLSA records synthesised from the expected keys) or DANE (TLSA records obtained by the application from DNS). TLSA records will also match the same key in the server certificate, should RPK use not happen to be negotiated.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for modular exponentiation and CRT offloading for the S390x architecture.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Juergen Christ</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added further assembler code for the RISC-V architecture.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Christoph Müllner</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added EC_GROUP_to_params() which creates an OSSL_PARAM array from a given EC_GROUP.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Oliver Mihatsch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Improved support for non-default library contexts and property queries when parsing PKCS#12 files.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Shane Lontis</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Implemented support for all five instances of EdDSA from RFC8032: Ed25519, Ed25519ctx, Ed25519ph, Ed448, and Ed448ph. The streaming is not yet supported for the HashEdDSA variants (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>James Muir</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added SM4 optimization for ARM processors using ASIMD and AES HW instructions.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Xu Yizhou</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Implemented SM4-XTS support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Xu Yizhou</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added platform-agnostic OSSL_sleep() function.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Implemented deterministic ECDSA signatures (RFC6979) support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Shane Lontis</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Implemented AES-GCM-SIV (RFC8452) support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for pluggable (provider-based) TLS signature algorithms. This enables TLS 1.3 authentication operations with algorithms embedded in providers not included by default in OpenSSL. In combination with the already available pluggable KEM and X.509 support, this enables for example suitable providers to deliver post-quantum or quantum-safe cryptography to OpenSSL users.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Michael Baentsch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for pluggable (provider-based) CMS signature algorithms. This enables CMS sign and verify operations with algorithms embedded in providers not included by default in OpenSSL.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Michael Baentsch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) as defined in RFC9180. HPKE is required for TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH), Message Layer Security (MLS) and other IETF specifications. HPKE can also be used by other applications that require encrypting "to" an ECDH public key. External APIs are defined in <a class="el" href="hpke_8h_source.html">include/openssl/hpke.h</a> and documented in doc/man3/OSSL_HPKE_CTX_new.pod</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Stephen Farrell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Implemented HPKE DHKEM support in providers used by HPKE (RFC9180) API.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Shane Lontis</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for certificate compression (RFC8879), including library support for Brotli and Zstandard compression.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add the ability to add custom attributes to PKCS12 files. Add a new API PKCS12_create_ex2, identical to the existing PKCS12_create_ex but allows for a user specified callback and optional argument. Added a new PKCS12_SAFEBAG_set0_attr, which allows for a new attr to be added to the existing STACK_OF attrs.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Graham Woodward</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Major refactor of the libssl record layer.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a mac salt length option for the pkcs12 command.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Xinping Chen</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add more SRTP protection profiles from RFC8723 and RFC8269.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kijin Kim</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Extended Kernel TLS (KTLS) to support TLS 1.3 receive offload.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Daiki Ueno, John Baldwin and Dmitry Podgorny</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for TCP Fast Open (RFC7413) to macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD where supported and enabled.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add ciphersuites based on DHE_PSK (RFC 4279) and ECDHE_PSK (RFC 5489) to the list of ciphersuites providing Perfect Forward Secrecy as required by SECLEVEL &gt;= 3.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Dmitry Belyavskiy, Nicola Tuveri</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add new SSL APIs to aid in efficiently implementing TLS/SSL fingerprinting. The SSL_CTRL_GET_IANA_GROUPS control code, exposed as the SSL_get0_iana_groups() function-like macro, retrieves the list of supported groups sent by the peer. The function SSL_client_hello_get_extension_order() populates a caller-supplied array with the list of extension types present in the ClientHello, in order of appearance.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Phus Lu</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey() and PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey_nid() to make it possible to use empty passphrase strings.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Darshan Sen</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The PKCS12_parse() function now supports MAC-less PKCS12 files.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Daniel Fiala</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added ASYNC_set_mem_functions() and ASYNC_get_mem_functions() calls to be able to change functions used for allocating the memory of asynchronous call stack.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Arran Cudbard-Bell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for signed BIGNUMs in the OSSL_PARAM APIs.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">A failure exit code is returned when using the openssl x509 command to check certificate attributes and the checks fail.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rami Khaldi</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2. RSA, DSA and DH keys of 1024 bits and above and less than 2048 bits and ECC keys of 160 bits and above and less than 224 bits were previously accepted by default but are now no longer allowed. By default TLS compression was already disabled in previous OpenSSL versions. At security level 2 it cannot be enabled.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list family functions now accept ciphers using their IANA standard names.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Erik Lax</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The PVK key derivation function has been moved from b2i_PVK_bio_ex() into the legacy crypto provider as an EVP_KDF. Applications requiring this KDF will need to load the legacy crypto provider.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">CCM8 cipher suites in TLS have been downgraded to security level zero because they use a short authentication tag which lowers their strength.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Subject or issuer names in X.509 objects are now displayed as UTF-8 strings by default.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Dmitry Belyavskiy</em></p>
</li>
<li>Add X.509 certificate codeSigning purpose and related checks on key usage and extended key usage of the leaf certificate according to the CA/Browser Forum.<ul>
<li>Lutz Jänicke*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The <code>x509</code>, <code>ca</code>, and <code>req</code> apps now produce X.509 v3 certificates. The <code>-x509v1</code> option of <code>req</code> prefers generation of X.509 v1 certificates. <code>X509_sign()</code> and <code>X509_sign_ctx()</code> make sure that the certificate has X.509 version 3 if the certificate information includes X.509 extensions.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix and extend certificate handling and the apps <code>x509</code>, <code>verify</code> etc. such as adding a trace facility for debugging certificate chain building.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Various fixes and extensions to the CMP+CRMF implementation and the <code>cmp</code> app in particular supporting requests for central key generation, generalized polling, and various types of genm/genp exchanges defined in CMP Updates.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixes and extensions to the HTTP client and to the HTTP server in <code>apps/</code> like correcting the TLS and proxy support and adding tracing for debugging.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Extended the CMS API for handling <code>CMS_SignedData</code> and <code>CMS_EnvelopedData</code>.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>CMS_add0_cert()</code> and <code>CMS_add1_cert()</code> no longer throw an error if a certificate to be added is already present. <code>CMS_sign_ex()</code> and <code>CMS_sign()</code> now ignore any duplicate certificates in their <code>certs</code> argument and no longer throw an error for them.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed and extended <code>util/check-format.pl</code> for checking adherence to the coding style <a href="https://www.openssl.org/policies/technical/coding-style.html">https://www.openssl.org/policies/technical/coding-style.html</a>. The checks are meanwhile more complete and yield fewer false positives.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>David von Oheimb</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added BIO_s_dgram_pair() and BIO_s_dgram_mem() that provide memory-based BIOs with datagram semantics and support for BIO_sendmmsg() and BIO_recvmmsg() calls. They can be used as the transport BIOs for QUIC.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Hugo Landau, Matt Caswell and Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add new BIO_sendmmsg() and BIO_recvmmsg() BIO methods which allow sending and receiving multiple messages in a single call. An implementation is provided for BIO_dgram. For further details, see BIO_sendmmsg(3).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Hugo Landau</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Support for loading root certificates from the Windows certificate store has been added. The support is in the form of a store which recognises the URI string of <code>org.openssl.winstore://</code>. This URI scheme currently takes no arguments. This store is built by default and can be disabled using the new compile-time option <code>no-winstore</code>. This store is not currently used by default and must be loaded explicitly using the above store URI. It is expected to be loaded by default in the future.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Hugo Landau</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Enable KTLS with the TLS 1.3 CCM mode ciphersuites. Note that some linux kernel versions that support KTLS have a known bug in CCM processing. That has been fixed in stable releases starting from 5.4.164, 5.10.84, 5.15.7, and all releases since 5.16. KTLS with CCM ciphersuites should be only used on these releases.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fix POLY1305 MAC implementation corrupting XMM registers on Windows.</p>
<p class="startli">The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.</p>
<p class="startli">The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fix excessive time spent checking DH q parameter value.</p>
<p class="startli">The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.</p>
<p class="startli">If DH_check() is called with such q parameter value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the computationally intensive checks are skipped.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix DH_check() excessive time with over sized modulus.</p>
<p class="startli">The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ("p" parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.</p>
<p class="startli">However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.</p>
<p class="startli">A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause DH_check() to fail.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Do not ignore empty associated data entries with AES-SIV.</p>
<p class="startli">The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call <code>EVP_EncryptUpdate()</code> (or <code>EVP_CipherUpdate()</code>) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-2975">CVE-2023-2975</a>)</p>
<p class="startli">Thanks to Juerg Wullschleger (Google) for discovering the issue.</p>
<p class="startli">The fix changes the authentication tag value and the ciphertext for applications that use empty associated data entries with AES-SIV.

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Mitigate for the time it takes for <code>OBJ_obj2txt</code> to translate gigantic OBJECT IDENTIFIER sub-identifiers to canonical numeric text form.</p>
<p class="startli">OBJ_obj2txt() would translate any size OBJECT IDENTIFIER to canonical numeric text form. For gigantic sub-identifiers, this would take a very long time, the time complexity being O(n^2) where n is the size of that sub-identifier. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-2650">CVE-2023-2650</a>)</p>
<p class="startli">To mitigitate this, <code>OBJ_obj2txt()</code> will only translate an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to canonical numeric text form if the size of that OBJECT IDENTIFIER is 586 bytes or less, and fail otherwise.</p>
<p class="startli">The basis for this restriction is <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2578#section-3.5">RFC 2578 (STD 58), section 3.5</a>. OBJECT IDENTIFIER values, which stipulates that OBJECT IDENTIFIERS may have at most 128 sub-identifiers, and that the maximum value that each sub- identifier may have is 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).</p>
<p class="startli">For each byte of every sub-identifier, only the 7 lower bits are part of the value, so the maximum amount of bytes that an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with these restrictions may occupy is 32 * 128 / 7, which is approximately 586 bytes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed NULL dereference during PKCS7 data verification.</p>
<p class="startli">A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-0401">CVE-2023-0401</a>)</p>
<p class="startli">PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName.</p>

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.</p>
<p class="startli">When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed NULL dereference validating DSA public key.</p>
<p class="startli">An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack.</p>
<p class="startli">The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF.</p>
<p class="startli">The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.</p>
<p class="startli">The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2023-0215">CVE-2023-0215</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Viktor Dukhovni, Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex.</p>
<p class="startli">The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash.</p>
<p class="startli">The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.</p>
<p class="startli">These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.

<p class="startli">A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2022-4304">CVE-2022-4304</a>)</p>

<p class="startli">A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.

<p class="startli">A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking.

<p class="startli">An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.

Changes between 3.0.5 and 3.0.6 [11 Oct 2022]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers.</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.</p>
<p class="startli">Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. ([CVE-2022-3358])</p>

Changes between 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 [5 Jul 2022]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation.</p>
<p class="startli">SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2022-2274">CVE-2022-2274</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further bugs where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection have been fixed.</p>
<p class="startli">When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.</p>
<p class="startli">This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.</p>
<p class="startli">Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. (CVE-2022-2068)</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Case insensitive string comparison is reimplemented via new locale-agnostic comparison functions OPENSSL_str[n]casecmp always using the POSIX locale for comparison. The previous implementation had problems when the Turkish locale was used.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a bug in the function <code>OCSP_basic_verify</code> that verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. The bug caused the function in the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used to return a postivie response (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify.</p>
<p class="startli">It is anticipated that most users of <code>OCSP_basic_verify</code> will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the <code>OCSP_basic_verify</code> function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL "ocsp" application. When verifying an ocsp response with the "-no_cert_checks" option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. ([CVE-2022-1343])</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a bug where the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly used the AAD data as the MAC key. This made the MAC key trivially predictable.</p>
<p class="startli">An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client.</p>
<p class="startli">If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite.</p>
<p class="startli">The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it.</p>
<p class="startli">In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred:</p>
<p class="startli">1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers</p>
<p class="startli">2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration)</p>
<p class="startli">3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list</p>
<p class="startli">4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1)</p>
<p class="startli">5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated</p>
<p class="startli">6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common (CVE-2022-1434)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix a bug in the OPENSSL_LH_flush() function that breaks reuse of the memory occupied by the removed hash table entries.</p>
<p class="startli">This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time.</p>
<p class="startli">Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. (CVE-2022-1473)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Hugo Landau, Aliaksei Levin</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The functions <code>OPENSSL_LH_stats</code> and <code>OPENSSL_LH_stats_bio</code> now only report the <code>num_items</code>, <code>num_nodes</code> and <code>num_alloc_nodes</code> statistics.

Changes between 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 [15 Mar 2022]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a bug in the BN_mod_sqrt() function that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli.</p>
<p class="startli">Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form.</p>
<p class="startli">It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters.</p>
<p class="startli">Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters.</p>
<p class="startli">Thus vulnerable situations include:</p><ul>
<li>TLS clients consuming server certificates</li>
<li>TLS servers consuming client certificates</li>
<li>Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers</li>
<li>Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers</li>
<li>Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. ([CVE-2022-0778])</p>

Changes between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 [14 Dec 2021]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed invalid handling of X509_verify_cert() internal errors in libssl Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. ([CVE-2021-4044])</p>

<li><p class="startli">OSSL_STORE_INFO_get_type() may now return an additional value. In 1.1.1 this function would return one of the values OSSL_STORE_INFO_NAME, OSSL_STORE_INFO_PKEY, OSSL_STORE_INFO_PARAMS, OSSL_STORE_INFO_CERT or OSSL_STORE_INFO_CRL. Decoded public keys would previously have been reported as type OSSL_STORE_INFO_PKEY in 1.1.1. In 3.0 decoded public keys are now reported as having the new type OSSL_STORE_INFO_PUBKEY.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to reuse the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low-level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<p class="startli"><em>Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">For built-in EC curves, ensure an EC_GROUP built from the curve name is used even when parsing explicit parameters, when loading a encoded key or calling <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecpkparameters()</code>/ <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecparameters()</code>. This prevents bypass of security hardening and performance gains, especially for curves with specialized EC_METHODs. By default, if a key encoded with explicit parameters is loaded and later encoded, the output is still encoded with explicit parameters, even if internally a "named" EC_GROUP is used for computation.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Nicola Tuveri</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Compute ECC cofactors if not provided during EC_GROUP construction. Before this change, EC_GROUP_set_generator would accept order and/or cofactor as NULL.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey. An attack is simple, if the first CMS_recipientInfo is valid but the second CMS_recipientInfo is chosen ciphertext. If the second recipientInfo decodes to PKCS #1 v1.5 form plaintext, the correct encryption key will be replaced by garbage, and the message cannot be decoded, but if the RSA decryption fails, the correct encryption key is used and the recipient will not notice the attack. As a work around for this potential attack the length of the decrypted key must be equal to the cipher default key length, in case the certificate is not given and all recipientInfo are tried out. The old behaviour can be re-enabled in the CMS code by setting the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Early start up entropy quality from the DEVRANDOM seed source has been improved for older Linux systems. The RAND subsystem will wait for /dev/random to be producing output before seeding from /dev/urandom.

The shared memory identifier can be configured by defining OPENSSL_RAND_SEED_DEVRANDOM_SHM_ID to the desired value. The default identifier is 114.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Revised BN_generate_prime_ex to not avoid factors 2..17863 in p-1 when primes for RSA keys are computed. Since we previously always generated primes == 2 (mod 3) for RSA keys, the 2-prime and 3-prime RSA modules were easy to distinguish, since <code>N = p*q = 1 (mod 3)</code>, but <code>N = p*q*r = 2 (mod 3)</code>. Therefore, fingerprinting 2-prime vs. 3-prime RSA keys was possible by computing N mod 3. This avoids possible fingerprinting of newly generated RSA modules.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bernd Edlinger</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Correct the extended master secret constant on EBCDIC systems. Without this fix TLS connections between an EBCDIC system and a non-EBCDIC system that negotiate EMS will fail. Unfortunately this also means that TLS connections between EBCDIC systems with this fix, and EBCDIC systems without this fix will fail if they negotiate EMS.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed the library initialisation so that the config file is now loaded by default. This was already the case for libssl. It now occurs for both libcrypto and libssl. Use the OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CONFIG option to <code>OPENSSL_init_crypto()</code> to suppress automatic loading of a config file.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Introduced new error raising macros, <code>ERR_raise()</code> and <code>ERR_raise_data()</code>, where the former acts as a replacement for <code>ERR_put_error()</code>, and the latter replaces the combination <code>ERR_put_error()</code> + <code>ERR_add_error_data()</code>. <code>ERR_raise_data()</code> adds more flexibility by taking a format string and an arbitrary number of arguments following it, to be processed with <code>BIO_snprintf()</code>.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Introduced a new function, <code>OSSL_PROVIDER_available()</code>, which can be used to check if a named provider is loaded and available. When called, it will also activate all fallback providers if such are still present.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Bernd Edlinger</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed DH parameters to generate the order q subgroup instead of 2q. Previously generated DH parameters are still accepted by DH_check but DH_generate_key works around that by clearing bit 0 of the private key for those. This avoids leaking bit 0 of the private key.</p>

An implementation of a key exchange algorithm can be obtained by using the function EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch().

</li>
<li><p class="startli">RC5_32_set_key has been changed to return an int type, with 0 indicating an error and 1 indicating success. In previous versions of OpenSSL this was a void type. If a key was set longer than the maximum possible this would crash.</p>

Changes between 1.1.1k and 1.1.1l [24 Aug 2021]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed an SM2 Decryption Buffer Overflow.</p>
<p class="startli">In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the "out" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the "outlen" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the "out" parameter.</p>
<p class="startli">A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small.</p>
<p class="startli">A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. ([CVE-2021-3711])</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed various read buffer overruns processing ASN.1 strings</p>
<p class="startli">ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are represented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte.</p>
<p class="startli">Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure.</p>
<p class="startli">However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the "data" and "length" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function.</p>
<p class="startli">Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the "data" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur.</p>
<p class="startli">The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions.</p>
<p class="startli">If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Changes between 1.1.1j and 1.1.1k [25 Mar 2021]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a problem with verifying a certificate chain when using the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag. This flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default.</p>
<p class="startli">Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check.</p>
<p class="startli">An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.</p>
<p class="startli">If a "purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application.</p>
<p class="startli">In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. ([CVE-2021-3450])</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Tomáš Mráz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed an issue where an OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed the X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() function. It attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However, it was failing to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. ([CVE-2021-23841])</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function and the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode to correctly check for rollback attacks. This is considered a bug in OpenSSL 1.1.1 because it does not support SSLv2. In 1.0.2 this is CVE-2021-23839.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
<p class="startli">Fixed the EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate functions. Previously they could overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissible length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call would be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value would be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed SRP_Calc_client_key so that it runs in constant time. The previous implementation called BN_mod_exp without setting BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

<li><p class="startli">Revised BN_generate_prime_ex to not avoid factors 3..17863 in p-1 when primes for RSA keys are computed. Since we previously always generated primes == 2 (mod 3) for RSA keys, the 2-prime and 3-prime RSA modules were easy to distinguish, since N = p*q = 1 (mod 3), but N = p*q*r = 2 (mod 3). Therefore, fingerprinting 2-prime vs. 3-prime RSA keys was possible by computing N mod 3. This avoids possible fingerprinting of newly generated RSA modules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a fork protection issue. OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However, this protection was not being used in the default case.</p>
<p class="startli">A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced.</p>

As a work around for this potential attack the length of the decrypted key must be equal to the cipher default key length, in case the certificate is not given and all recipientInfo are tried out. The old behaviour can be re-enabled in the CMS code by setting the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2019-1563">CVE-2019-1563</a>)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Prevent over long nonces in ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>
<p class="startli">ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored.</p>
<p class="startli">It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce.</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 16th of March 2019 by Joran Dirk Greef of Ronomon. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2019-1543">CVE-2019-1543</a>)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Add DEVRANDOM_WAIT feature for Linux systems</p>
<p class="startli">On older Linux systems where the getrandom() system call is not available, OpenSSL normally uses the /dev/urandom device for seeding its CSPRNG. Contrary to getrandom(), the /dev/urandom device will not block during early boot when the kernel CSPRNG has not been seeded yet.</p>
<p class="startli">To mitigate this known weakness, use select() to wait for /dev/random to become readable before reading from /dev/urandom.</p>

Changes between 1.1.1a and 1.1.1b [26 Feb 2019]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Change the info callback signals for the start and end of a post-handshake message exchange in TLSv1.3. In 1.1.1/1.1.1a we used SSL_CB_HANDSHAKE_START and SSL_CB_HANDSHAKE_DONE. Experience has shown that many applications get confused by this and assume that a TLSv1.2 renegotiation has started. This can break KeyUpdate handling. Instead we no longer signal the start and end of a post handshake message exchange (although the messages themselves are still signalled). This could break some applications that were expecting the old signals. However without this KeyUpdate is not usable for many applications.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation</p>
<p class="startli">The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 16th October 2018 by Samuel Weiser. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2018-0734">CVE-2018-0734</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation</p>
<p class="startli">The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 25th October 2018 by Samuel Weiser. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2018-0735">CVE-2018-0735</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed the issue that RAND_add()/RAND_seed() silently discards random input if its length exceeds 4096 bytes. The limit has been raised to a buffer size of two gigabytes and the error handling improved.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Dr. Falko Strenzke. It has been categorized as a normal bug, not a security issue, because the DRBG reseeds automatically and is fully functional even without additional randomness provided by the application.</p>

Changes between 1.1.0i and 1.1.1 [11 Sep 2018]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Add a new ClientHello callback. Provides a callback interface that gives the application the ability to adjust the nascent SSL object at the earliest stage of ClientHello processing, immediately after extensions have been collected but before they have been processed. In particular, this callback can adjust the supported TLS versions in response to the contents of the ClientHello</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Benjamin Kaduk</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add SM2 base algorithm support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Jack Lloyd</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">s390x assembly pack: add (improved) hardware-support for the following cryptographic primitives: sha3, shake, aes-gcm, aes-ccm, aes-ctr, aes-ofb, aes-cfb/cfb8, aes-ecb.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Patrick Steuer</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Make EVP_PKEY_asn1_new() a bit stricter about its input. A NULL pem_str parameter is no longer accepted, as it leads to a corrupt table. NULL pem_str is reserved for alias entries only.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Use the new ec_scalar_mul_ladder scaffold to implement a specialized ladder step for prime curves. The new implementation is based on formulae from differential addition-and-doubling in homogeneous projective coordinates from Izu-Takagi "A fast parallel elliptic curve multiplication resistant
   against side channel attacks" and Brier-Joye "Weierstrass Elliptic Curves
   and Side-Channel Attacks" Eq. (8) for y-coordinate recovery, modified to work in projective coordinates.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley, Nicola Tuveri</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change generating and checking of primes so that the error rate of not being prime depends on the intended use based on the size of the input. For larger primes this will result in more rounds of Miller-Rabin. The maximal error rate for primes with more than 1080 bits is lowered to 2^-128.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx, Annie Yousar</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Increase the number of Miller-Rabin rounds for DSA key generating to 64.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The 'tsget' script is renamed to 'tsget.pl', to avoid confusion when moving between systems, and to avoid confusion when a Windows build is done with mingw vs with MSVC. For POSIX installs, there's still a symlink or copy named 'tsget' to avoid that confusion as well.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Revert blinding in ECDSA sign and instead make problematic addition length-invariant. Switch even to fixed-length Montgomery multiplication.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Use the new ec_scalar_mul_ladder scaffold to implement a specialized ladder step for binary curves. The new implementation is based on formulae from differential addition-and-doubling in mixed Lopez-Dahab projective coordinates, modified to independently blind the operands.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a scaffold to optionally enhance the Montgomery ladder implementation for <code>ec_scalar_mul_ladder</code> (formerly <code>ec_mul_consttime</code>) allowing EC_METHODs to implement their own specialized "ladder step", to take advantage of more favorable coordinate systems or more efficient differential addition-and-doubling algorithms.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Modified the random device based seed sources to keep the relevant file descriptors open rather than reopening them on each access. This allows such sources to operate in a chroot() jail without the associated device nodes being available. This behaviour can be controlled using RAND_keep_random_devices_open().</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Numerous side-channel attack mitigations have been applied. This may have performance impacts for some algorithms for the benefit of improved security. Specific changes are noted in this change log by their respective authors.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">AIX shared library support overhaul. Switch to AIX "natural" way of handling shared libraries, which means collecting shared objects of different versions and bitnesses in one common archive. This allows to mitigate conflict between 1.0 and 1.1 side-by-side installations. It doesn't affect the way 3rd party applications are linked, only how multi-version installation is managed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Make ec_group_do_inverse_ord() more robust and available to other EC cryptosystems, so that irrespective of BN_FLG_CONSTTIME, SCA mitigations are applied to the fallback BN_mod_inverse(). When using this function rather than BN_mod_inverse() directly, new EC cryptosystem implementations are then safer-by-default.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add coordinate blinding for EC_POINT and implement projective coordinate blinding for generic prime curves as a countermeasure to chosen point SCA attacks.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add blinding to ECDSA and DSA signatures to protect against side channel attacks discovered by Keegan Ryan (NCC Group).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Enforce checking in the <code>pkeyutl</code> command to ensure that the input length does not exceed the maximum supported digest length when performing a sign, verify or verifyrecover operation.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY is enabled by default. Applications that use blocking I/O in combination with something like select() or poll() will hang. This can be turned off again using SSL_CTX_clear_mode(). Many applications do not properly handle non-application data records, and TLS 1.3 sends more of such records. Setting SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY works around the problems in those applications, but can also break some. It's recommended to read the manpages about SSL_read(), SSL_write(), SSL_get_error(), SSL_shutdown(), SSL_CTX_set_mode() and SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead() again.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">When unlocking a pass phrase protected PEM file or PKCS#8 container, we now allow empty (zero character) pass phrases.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Apply blinding to binary field modular inversion and remove patent pending (OPENSSL_SUN_GF2M_DIV) BN_GF2m_mod_div implementation.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Deprecate ec2_mult.c and unify scalar multiplication code paths for binary and prime elliptic curves.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Remove ECDSA nonce padding: EC_POINT_mul is now responsible for constant time fixed point multiplication.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li>Revise elliptic curve scalar multiplication with timing attack defenses: ec_wNAF_mul redirects to a constant time implementation when computing fixed point and variable point multiplication (which in OpenSSL are mostly used with secret scalars in keygen, sign, ECDH derive operations). <em>Billy Bob Brumley, Nicola Tuveri, Cesar Pereida García, Sohaib ul Hassan</em></li>
<li><p class="startli">Updated CONTRIBUTING</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Updated DRBG / RAND to request nonce and additional low entropy randomness from the system.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matthias St. Pierre</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Updated 'openssl rehash' to use OpenSSL consistent default.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Moved the load of the ssl_conf module to libcrypto, which helps loading engines that libssl uses before libssl is initialised.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added EVP_PKEY_sign() and EVP_PKEY_verify() for EdDSA</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Added output of accepting IP address and port for 'openssl s_server'</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added a new API for TLSv1.3 ciphersuites: SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites() SSL_set_ciphersuites()</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Memory allocation failures consistently add an error to the error stack.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Don't use OPENSSL_ENGINES and OPENSSL_CONF environment values in libcrypto when run as setuid/setgid.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bernd Edlinger</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Load any config file by default when libssl is used.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added new public header file &lt;openssl/rand_drbg.h&gt; and documentation for the RAND_DRBG API. See manual page RAND_DRBG(7) for an overview.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matthias St. Pierre</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">QNX support removed (cannot find contributors to get their approval for the license change).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">TLSv1.3 replay protection for early data has been implemented. See the SSL_read_early_data() man page for further details.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Separated TLSv1.3 ciphersuite configuration out from TLSv1.2 ciphersuite configuration. TLSv1.3 ciphersuites are not compatible with TLSv1.2 and below. Similarly TLSv1.2 ciphersuites are not compatible with TLSv1.3. In order to avoid issues where legacy TLSv1.2 ciphersuite configuration would otherwise inadvertently disable all TLSv1.3 ciphersuites the configuration has been separated out. See the ciphers man page or the SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites() man page for more information.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">On POSIX (BSD, Linux, ...) systems the ocsp(1) command running in responder mode now supports the new "-multi" option, which spawns the specified number of child processes to handle OCSP requests. The "-timeout" option now also limits the OCSP responder's patience to wait to receive the full client request on a newly accepted connection. Child processes are respawned as needed, and the CA index file is automatically reloaded when changed. This makes it possible to run the "ocsp" responder as a long-running service, making the OpenSSL CA somewhat more feature-complete. In this mode, most diagnostic messages logged after entering the event loop are logged via syslog(3) rather than written to stderr.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Viktor Dukhovni</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for X448 and Ed448. Heavily based on original work by Mike Hamburg.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Extend OSSL_STORE with capabilities to search and to narrow the set of objects loaded. This adds the functions OSSL_STORE_expect() and OSSL_STORE_find() as well as needed tools to construct searches and get the search data out of them.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Support for TLSv1.3 added. Note that users upgrading from an earlier version of OpenSSL should review their configuration settings to ensure that they are still appropriate for TLSv1.3. For further information see: <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/TLS1.3">https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/TLS1.3</a></p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Grand redesign of the OpenSSL random generator</p>
<p class="startli">The default RAND method now utilizes an AES-CTR DRBG according to NIST standard SP 800-90Ar1. The new random generator is essentially a port of the default random generator from the OpenSSL FIPS 2.0 object module. It is a hybrid deterministic random bit generator using an AES-CTR bit stream and which seeds and reseeds itself automatically using trusted system entropy sources.</p>
<p class="startli">Some of its new features are:</p><ul>
<li>Support for multiple DRBG instances with seed chaining.</li>
<li>The default RAND method makes use of a DRBG.</li>
<li>There is a public and private DRBG instance.</li>
<li>The DRBG instances are fork-safe.</li>
<li>Keep all global DRBG instances on the secure heap if it is enabled.</li>
<li>The public and private DRBG instance are per thread for lock free operation</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale, Benjamin Kaduk, Kurt Roeckx, Rich Salz, Matthias St. Pierre</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed Configure so it only says what it does and doesn't dump so much data. Instead, ./configdata.pm should be used as a script to display all sorts of configuration data.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added processing of "make variables" to Configure.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Added SHA512/224 and SHA512/256 algorithm support.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Paul Dale</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">The last traces of Netware support, first removed in 1.1.0, have now been removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Get rid of Makefile.shared, and in the process, make the processing of certain files (rc.obj, or the .def/.map/.opt files produced from the ordinal files) more visible and hopefully easier to trace and debug (or make silent).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Make it possible to have environment variable assignments as arguments to config / Configure.</p>

<li><p class="startli">The UI API becomes a permanent and integral part of libcrypto, i.e. not possible to disable entirely. However, it's still possible to disable the console reading UI method, UI_OpenSSL() (use UI_null() as a fallback).</p>
<p class="startli">To disable, configure with 'no-ui-console'. 'no-ui' is still possible to use as an alias. Check at compile time with the macro OPENSSL_NO_UI_CONSOLE. The macro OPENSSL_NO_UI is still possible to check and is an alias for OPENSSL_NO_UI_CONSOLE.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a STORE module, which implements a uniform and URI based reader of stores that can contain keys, certificates, CRLs and numerous other objects. The main API is loosely based on a few stdio functions, and includes OSSL_STORE_open, OSSL_STORE_load, OSSL_STORE_eof, OSSL_STORE_error and OSSL_STORE_close. The implementation uses backends called "loaders" to implement arbitrary URI schemes. There is one built in "loader" for the 'file' scheme.</p>

In theory it is permissible in SSLv3 - TLSv1.2 to fragment such alerts across multiple records (some of which could be empty). In practice it make no sense to send an empty alert record, or to fragment one. TLSv1.3 prohibits this altogether and other libraries (BoringSSL, NSS) do not support this at all. Supporting it adds significant complexity to the record layer, and its removal is unlikely to cause interoperability issues.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">For built-in EC curves, ensure an EC_GROUP built from the curve name is used even when parsing explicit parameters, when loading a encoded key or calling <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecpkparameters()</code>/ <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecparameters()</code>. This prevents bypass of security hardening and performance gains, especially for curves with specialized EC_METHODs. By default, if a key encoded with explicit parameters is loaded and later encoded, the output is still encoded with explicit parameters, even if internally a "named" EC_GROUP is used for computation.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey. An attack is simple, if the first CMS_recipientInfo is valid but the second CMS_recipientInfo is chosen ciphertext. If the second recipientInfo decodes to PKCS #1 v1.5 form plaintext, the correct encryption key will be replaced by garbage, and the message cannot be decoded, but if the RSA decryption fails, the correct encryption key is used and the recipient will not notice the attack. As a work around for this potential attack the length of the decrypted key must be equal to the cipher default key length, in case the certificate is not given and all recipientInfo are tried out. The old behaviour can be re-enabled in the CMS code by setting the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2019-1563">CVE-2019-1563</a>)</p>

Changes between 1.1.0j and 1.1.0k [28 May 2019]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Change the default RSA, DSA and DH size to 2048 bit instead of 1024. This changes the size when using the <code>genpkey</code> command when no size is given. It fixes an omission in earlier changes that changed all RSA, DSA and DH generation commands to use 2048 bits by default.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Prevent over long nonces in ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>
<p class="startli">ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored.</p>
<p class="startli">It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce.</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 16th of March 2019 by Joran Dirk Greef of Ronomon. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2019-1543">CVE-2019-1543</a>)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Client DoS due to large DH parameter</p>
<p class="startli">During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished.

<li><p class="startli">Fixed a text canonicalisation bug in CMS</p>
<p class="startli">Where a CMS detached signature is used with text content the text goes through a canonicalisation process first prior to signing or verifying a signature. This process strips trailing space at the end of lines, converts line terminators to CRLF and removes additional trailing line terminators at the end of a file. A bug in the canonicalisation process meant that some characters, such as form-feed, were incorrectly treated as whitespace and removed. This is contrary to the specification (RFC5485). This fix could mean that detached text data signed with an earlier version of OpenSSL 1.1.0 may fail to verify using the fixed version, or text data signed with a fixed OpenSSL may fail to verify with an earlier version of OpenSSL 1.1.0. A workaround is to only verify the canonicalised text data and use the "-binary" flag (for the "cms" command line application) or set the SMIME_BINARY/PKCS7_BINARY/CMS_BINARY flags (if using CMS_verify()).</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Incorrect CRYPTO_memcmp on HP-UX PA-RISC</p>
<p class="startli">Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.</p>

Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.</p>

<p class="startli">There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour.

<p class="startli">The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a.</p>

Changes between 1.1.0 and 1.1.0a [22 Sep 2016]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth</p>
<p class="startli">A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the "no-ocsp" build time option are not affected.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.) (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2016-6304">CVE-2016-6304</a>)</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">SSL_peek() hang on empty record</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL 1.1.0 SSL/TLS will hang during a call to SSL_peek() if the peer sends an empty record. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial Of Service attack.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Alex Gaynor. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2016-6305">CVE-2016-6305</a>)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Excessive allocation of memory in tls_get_message_header() and dtls1_preprocess_fragment()</p>
<p class="startli">A (D)TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the failed connection in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore, the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:</p>
<p class="startli">1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.</p>
<p class="startli">Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">solaris-x86-cc, i.e. 32-bit configuration with vendor compiler, had to be removed. Primary reason is that vendor assembler can't assemble our modules with -KPIC flag. As result it, assembly support, was not even available as option. But its lack means lack of side-channel resistant code, which is incompatible with security by todays standards. Fortunately gcc is readily available prepackaged option, which we firmly point at...</p>

Changes between 1.0.2h and 1.1.0 [25 Aug 2016]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Windows command-line tool supports UTF-8 opt-in option for arguments and console input. Setting OPENSSL_WIN32_UTF8 environment variable (to any value) allows Windows user to access PKCS#12 file generated with Windows CryptoAPI and protected with non-ASCII password, as well as files generated under UTF-8 locale on Linux also protected with non-ASCII password.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">To mitigate the SWEET32 attack (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2016-2183">CVE-2016-2183</a>), 3DES cipher suites have been disabled by default and removed from DEFAULT, just like RC4. See the RC4 item below to re-enable both.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The method for finding the storage location for the Windows RAND seed file has changed. First we check RANDFILE%. If that is not set then we check the directories HOME%, USERPROFILE% and SYSTEMROOT% in that order. If all else fails we fall back to C:.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The EVP_EncryptUpdate() function has had its return type changed from void to int. A return of 0 indicates and error while a return of 1 indicates success.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The flags RSA_FLAG_NO_CONSTTIME, DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME and DH_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME which previously provided the ability to switch off the constant time implementation for RSA, DSA and DH have been made no-ops and deprecated.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Windows RAND implementation was simplified to only get entropy by calling CryptGenRandom(). Various other RAND-related tickets were also closed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Joseph Wylie Yandle, Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The stack and lhash API's were renamed to start with <code>OPENSSL_SK_</code> and <code>OPENSSL_LH_</code>, respectively. The old names are available with API compatibility. They new names are now completely documented.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Unify TYPE_up_ref(obj) methods signature. SSL_CTX_up_ref(), SSL_up_ref(), X509_up_ref(), EVP_PKEY_up_ref(), X509_CRL_up_ref(), X509_OBJECT_up_ref_count() methods are now returning an int (instead of void) like all others TYPE_up_ref() methods. So now these methods also check the return value of CRYPTO_atomic_add(), and the validity of object reference counter.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Remove openssl.spec. Packaging files belong with the packagers.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li>Automatic Darwin/OSX configuration has had a refresh, it will now recognise x86_64 architectures automatically. You can still decide to build for a different bitness with the environment variable KERNEL_BITS (can be 32 or 64), for example: <pre class="fragment">    KERNEL_BITS=32 ./config

<li><p class="startli">To enable users to have their own config files and build file templates, Configure looks in the directory indicated by the environment variable OPENSSL_LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR as well as the in-source Configurations/ directory. On VMS, OPENSSL_LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is expected to be a logical name and is used as is.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The following datatypes were made opaque: X509_OBJECT, X509_STORE_CTX, X509_STORE, X509_LOOKUP, and X509_LOOKUP_METHOD. The unused type X509_CERT_FILE_CTX was removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>

<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Make various cleanup routines no-ops and mark them as deprecated. Most global cleanup functions are no longer required because they are handled via auto-deinit (see OPENSSL_init_crypto and OPENSSL_init_ssl man pages). Explicitly de-initing can cause problems (e.g. where a library that uses OpenSSL de-inits, but an application is still using it). The affected functions are CONF_modules_free(), ENGINE_cleanup(), OBJ_cleanup(), EVP_cleanup(), BIO_sock_cleanup(), CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data(), RAND_cleanup(), SSL_COMP_free_compression_methods(), ERR_free_strings() and COMP_zlib_cleanup().</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">&ndash;strict-warnings no longer enables runtime debugging options such as REF_DEBUG. Instead, debug options are automatically enabled with '&ndash;debug' builds.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov, Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Made DH and DH_METHOD opaque. The structures for managing DH objects have been moved out of the public header files. New functions for managing these have been added.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Made RSA and RSA_METHOD opaque. The structures for managing RSA objects have been moved out of the public header files. New functions for managing these have been added.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed the aged BC-32 config and all its supporting scripts</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed support for Ultrix, Netware, and OS/2.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for HKDF.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Alessandro Ghedini</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for blake2b and blake2s</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bill Cox</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for "pipelining". Ciphers that have the EVP_CIPH_FLAG_PIPELINE flag set have a capability to process multiple encryptions/decryptions simultaneously. There are currently no built-in ciphers with this property but the expectation is that engines will be able to offer it to significantly improve throughput. Support has been extended into libssl so that multiple records for a single connection can be processed in one go (for &gt;=TLS 1.1).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added the AFALG engine. This is an async capable engine which is able to offload work to the Linux kernel. In this initial version it only supports AES128-CBC. The kernel must be version 4.1.0 or greater.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Catriona Lucey</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">OpenSSL now uses a new threading API. It is no longer necessary to set locking callbacks to use OpenSSL in a multi-threaded environment. There are two supported threading models: pthreads and windows threads. It is also possible to configure OpenSSL at compile time for "no-threads". The old threading API should no longer be used. The functions have been replaced with "no-op" compatibility macros.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Alessandro Ghedini, Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Modify behavior of ALPN to invoke callback after SNI/servername callback, such that updates to the SSL_CTX affect ALPN.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add SSL_CIPHER queries for authentication and key-exchange.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Todd Short</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changes to the DEFAULT cipherlist:</p><ul>
<li>Prefer (EC)DHE handshakes over plain RSA.</li>
<li>Prefer AEAD ciphers over legacy ciphers.</li>
<li>Prefer ECDSA over RSA when both certificates are available.</li>
<li>Prefer TLSv1.2 ciphers/PRF.</li>
<li>Remove DSS, SEED, IDEA, CAMELLIA, and AES-CCM from the default cipherlist.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the ECC default curve list to be this, in order: x25519, secp256r1, secp521r1, secp384r1.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">RC4 based libssl ciphersuites are now classed as "weak" ciphers and are disabled by default. They can be re-enabled using the enable-weak-ssl-ciphers option to Configure.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">If the server has ALPN configured, but supports no protocols that the client advertises, send a fatal "no_application_protocol" alert. This behaviour is SHALL in RFC 7301, though it isn't universally implemented by other servers.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add X25519 support. Add ASN.1 and EVP_PKEY methods for X25519. This includes support for public and private key encoding using the format documented in draft-ietf-curdle-pkix-02. The corresponding EVP_PKEY method supports key generation and key derivation.</p>
<p class="startli">TLS support complies with draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-08 and uses X25519(29).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Deprecate SRP_VBASE_get_by_user. SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had inconsistent memory management behaviour. In order to fix an unavoidable memory leak (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2016-0798">CVE-2016-0798</a>), SRP_VBASE_get_by_user was changed to ignore the "fake user" SRP seed, even if the seed is configured.</p>
<p class="startli">Users should use SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user instead. Note that in SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user, caller must free the returned value. Note also that even though configuring the SRP seed attempts to hide invalid usernames by continuing the handshake with fake credentials, this behaviour is not constant time and no strong guarantees are made that the handshake is indistinguishable from that of a valid user.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Configuration change; it's now possible to build dynamic engines without having to build shared libraries and vice versa. This only applies to the engines in <code>engines/</code>, those in <code>crypto/engine/</code> will always be built into libcrypto (i.e. "static").</p>
<p class="startli">Building dynamic engines is enabled by default; to disable, use the configuration option "disable-dynamic-engine".</p>
<p class="startli">The only requirements for building dynamic engines are the presence of the DSO module and building with position independent code, so they will also automatically be disabled if configuring with "disable-dso" or "disable-pic".</p>
<p class="startli">The macros OPENSSL_NO_STATIC_ENGINE and OPENSSL_NO_DYNAMIC_ENGINE are also taken away from <a class="el" href="opensslconf_8h_source.html">openssl/opensslconf.h</a>, as they are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Configuration change; if there is a known flag to compile position independent code, it will always be applied on the libcrypto and libssl object files, and never on the application object files. This means other libraries that use routines from libcrypto / libssl can be made into shared libraries regardless of how OpenSSL was configured.</p>
<p class="startli">If this isn't desirable, the configuration options "disable-pic" or "no-pic" can be used to disable the use of PIC. This will also disable building shared libraries and dynamic engines.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed JPAKE code. It was experimental and has no wide use.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The INSTALL_PREFIX Makefile variable has been renamed to DESTDIR. That makes for less confusion on what this variable is for. Also, the configuration option &ndash;install_prefix is removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Heartbeat for TLS has been removed and is disabled by default for DTLS; configure with enable-heartbeats. Code that uses the old define's might need to be updated.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper, Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Rename REF_CHECK to REF_DEBUG.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New "unified" build system</p>
<p class="startli">The "unified" build system is aimed to be a common system for all platforms we support. With it comes new support for VMS.</p>
<p class="startli">This system builds supports building in a different directory tree than the source tree. It produces one Makefile (for unix family or lookalikes), or one descrip.mms (for VMS).</p>
<p class="startli">The source of information to make the Makefile / descrip.mms is small files called 'build.info', holding the necessary information for each directory with source to compile, and a template in Configurations, like unix-Makefile.tmpl or descrip.mms.tmpl.</p>
<p class="startli">With this change, the library names were also renamed on Windows and on VMS. They now have names that are closer to the standard on Unix, and include the major version number, and in certain cases, the architecture they are built for. See "Notes on shared
   libraries" in INSTALL.</p>
<p class="startli">We rely heavily on the perl module Text::Template.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added support for auto-initialisation and de-initialisation of the library. OpenSSL no longer requires explicit init or deinit routines to be called, except in certain circumstances. See the OPENSSL_init_crypto() and OPENSSL_init_ssl() man pages for further information.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li>The arguments to the DTLSv1_listen function have changed. Specifically the "peer" argument is now expected to be a BIO_ADDR object.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Rewrite of BIO networking library. The BIO library lacked consistent support of IPv6, and adding it required some more extensive modifications. This introduces the BIO_ADDR and BIO_ADDRINFO types, which hold all types of addresses and chains of address information. It also introduces a new API, with functions like BIO_socket, BIO_connect, BIO_listen, BIO_lookup and a rewrite of BIO_accept. The source/sink BIOs BIO_s_connect, BIO_s_accept and BIO_s_datagram have been adapted accordingly.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_1 now accepts inputs with and without the leading 0-byte.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">CRIME protection: disable compression by default, even if OpenSSL is compiled with zlib enabled. Applications can still enable compression by calling SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION), or by using the SSL_CONF library to configure compression.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The signature of the session callback configured with SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb was changed. The read-only input buffer was explicitly marked as <code>const unsigned char*</code> instead of <code>unsigned char*</code>.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Always DPURIFY. Remove the use of uninitialized memory in the RNG, and other conditional uses of DPURIFY. This makes -DPURIFY a no-op.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Emilia Käsper</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed many obsolete configuration items, including DES_PTR, DES_RISC1, DES_RISC2, DES_INT MD2_CHAR, MD2_INT, MD2_LONG BF_PTR, BF_PTR2 IDEA_SHORT, IDEA_LONG RC2_SHORT, RC2_LONG, RC4_LONG, RC4_CHUNK, RC4_INDEX</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz, with advice from Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Many BN internals have been moved to an internal header file.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz with help from Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Configuration and writing out the results from it has changed. Files such as Makefile <a class="el" href="opensslconf_8h_source.html">include/openssl/opensslconf.h</a> and are now produced through general templates, such as Makefile.in and crypto/opensslconf.h.in and some help from the perl module Text::Template.</p>
<p class="startli">Also, the center of configuration information is no longer Makefile. Instead, Configure produces a perl module in configdata.pm which holds most of the config data (in the hash table config), the target data that comes from the target configuration in one of the <code>Configurations/*.conf</code> files (in target).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">To clarify their intended purposes, the Configure options &ndash;prefix and &ndash;openssldir change their semantics, and become more straightforward and less interdependent.</p>
<p class="startli">&ndash;prefix shall be used exclusively to give the location INSTALLTOP where programs, scripts, libraries, include files and manuals are going to be installed. The default is now /usr/local.</p>
<p class="startli">&ndash;openssldir shall be used exclusively to give the default location OPENSSLDIR where certificates, private keys, CRLs are managed. This is also where the default openssl.cnf gets installed. If the directory given with this option is a relative path, the values of both the &ndash;prefix value and the &ndash;openssldir value will be combined to become OPENSSLDIR. The default for &ndash;openssldir is INSTALLTOP/ssl.</p>
<p class="startli">Anyone who uses &ndash;openssldir to specify where OpenSSL is to be installed MUST change to use &ndash;prefix instead.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The GOST engine was out of date and therefore it has been removed. An up to date GOST engine is now being maintained in an external repository. See: <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries">https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries</a>. Libssl still retains support for GOST ciphersuites (these are only activated if a GOST engine is present).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">EGD is no longer supported by default; use enable-egd when configuring.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ben Kaduk and Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The distribution now has Makefile.in files, which are used to create Makefile's when Configure is run. <em>Configure must be run before trying to build now.</em></p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The return value for SSL_CIPHER_description() for error conditions has changed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Support for RFC6698/RFC7671 DANE TLSA peer authentication.</p>
<p class="startli">Obtaining and performing DNSSEC validation of TLSA records is the application's responsibility. The application provides the TLSA records of its choice to OpenSSL, and these are then used to authenticate the peer.</p>
<p class="startli">The TLSA records need not even come from DNS. They can, for example, be used to implement local end-entity certificate or trust-anchor "pinning", where the "pin" data takes the form of TLSA records, which can augment or replace verification based on the usual WebPKI public certification authorities.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Viktor Dukhovni</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Revert default OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED setting. Instead OpenSSL continues to support deprecated interfaces in default builds. However, applications are strongly advised to compile their source files with -DOPENSSL_API_COMPAT=0x10100000L, which hides the declarations of all interfaces deprecated in 0.9.8, 1.0.0 or the 1.1.0 releases.</p>
<p class="startli">In environments in which all applications have been ported to not use any deprecated interfaces OpenSSL's Configure script should be used with the &ndash;api=1.1.0 option to entirely remove support for the deprecated features from the library and unconditionally disable them in the installed headers. Essentially the same effect can be achieved with the "no-deprecated" argument to Configure, except that this will always restrict the build to just the latest API, rather than a fixed API version.</p>
<p class="startli">As applications are ported to future revisions of the API, they should update their compile-time OPENSSL_API_COMPAT define accordingly, but in most cases should be able to continue to compile with later releases.</p>
<p class="startli">The OPENSSL_API_COMPAT versions for 1.0.0, and 0.9.8 are 0x10000000L and 0x00908000L, respectively. However those versions did not support the OPENSSL_API_COMPAT feature, and so applications are not typically tested for explicit support of just the undeprecated features of either release.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Viktor Dukhovni</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for setting the minimum and maximum supported protocol. It can bet set via the SSL_set_min_proto_version() and SSL_set_max_proto_version(), or via the SSL_CONF's MinProtocol and MaxProtocol. It's recommended to use the new APIs to disable protocols instead of disabling individual protocols using SSL_set_options() or SSL_CONF's Protocol. This change also removes support for disabling TLS 1.2 in the OpenSSL TLS client at compile time by defining OPENSSL_NO_TLS1_2_CLIENT.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Support for ChaCha20 and Poly1305 added to libcrypto and libssl.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New EC_KEY_METHOD, this replaces the older ECDSA_METHOD and ECDH_METHOD and integrates ECDSA and ECDH functionality into EC. Implementations can now redirect key generation and no longer need to convert to or from ECDSA_SIG format.</p>
<p class="startli">Note: the <a class="el" href="ecdsa_8h_source.html">ecdsa.h</a> and <a class="el" href="ecdh_8h_source.html">ecdh.h</a> headers are now no longer needed and just include the ec.h header file instead.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Remove support for all 40 and 56 bit ciphers. This includes all the export ciphers who are no longer supported and drops support the ephemeral RSA key exchange. The LOW ciphers currently doesn't have any ciphers in it.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Made EVP_MD_CTX, EVP_MD, EVP_CIPHER_CTX, EVP_CIPHER and HMAC_CTX opaque. For HMAC_CTX, the following constructors and destructors were added: </p><pre class="fragment">HMAC_CTX *HMAC_CTX_new(void);
void HMAC_CTX_free(HMAC_CTX *ctx);
</pre><p> For EVP_MD and EVP_CIPHER, complete APIs to create, fill and destroy such methods has been added. See EVP_MD_meth_new(3) and EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3) for documentation.</p>
<p class="startli">Additional changes: 1) <code>EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup()</code>, <code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup()</code> and <code>HMAC_CTX_cleanup()</code> were removed. <code>HMAC_CTX_reset()</code> and <code>EVP_MD_CTX_reset()</code> should be called instead to reinitialise an already created structure. 2) For consistency with the majority of our object creators and destructors, <code>EVP_MD_CTX_(create|destroy)</code> were renamed to <code>EVP_MD_CTX_(new|free)</code>. The old names are retained as macros for deprecated builds.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added ASYNC support. Libcrypto now includes the async sub-library to enable cryptographic operations to be performed asynchronously as long as an asynchronous capable engine is used. See the ASYNC_start_job() man page for further details. Libssl has also had this capability integrated with the introduction of the new mode SSL_MODE_ASYNC and associated error SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC. See the SSL_CTX_set_mode() and SSL_get_error() man pages. This work was developed in partnership with Intel Corp.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">SSL_{CTX_}set_ecdh_auto() has been removed and ECDH is support is always enabled now. If you want to disable the support you should exclude it using the list of supported ciphers. This also means that the "-no_ecdhe" option has been removed from s_server.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>

<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">State machine rewrite. The state machine code has been significantly refactored in order to remove much duplication of code and solve issues with the old code (see <a class="el" href="md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2ssl_2statem_2_r_e_a_d_m_e.html">ssl/statem/README.md</a> for further details). This change does have some associated API changes. Notably the SSL_state() function has been removed and replaced by SSL_get_state which now returns an "OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATE" instead of an int. SSL_set_state() has been removed altogether. The previous handshake states defined in ssl.h and <a class="el" href="ssl3_8h_source.html">ssl3.h</a> have also been removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">All instances of the string "ssleay" in the public API were replaced with OpenSSL (case-matching; e.g., OPENSSL_VERSION for define's) Some error codes related to internal RSA_eay API's were renamed.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell, Rich Salz</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New ASN.1 embed macro.</p>
<p class="startli">New ASN.1 macro ASN1_EMBED. This is the same as ASN1_SIMPLE except the structure is not allocated: it is part of the parent. That is instead of </p><pre class="fragment">    FOO *x;
</pre><p> it must be: </p><pre class="fragment">    FOO x;
</pre><p> This reduces memory fragmentation and make it impossible to accidentally set a mandatory field to NULL.</p>
<p class="startli">This currently only works for some fields specifically a SEQUENCE, CHOICE, or ASN1_STRING type which is part of a parent SEQUENCE. Since it is equivalent to ASN1_SIMPLE it cannot be tagged, OPTIONAL, SET OF or SEQUENCE OF.</p>

<li><p class="startli">The return type of BIO_number_read() and BIO_number_written() as well as the corresponding num_read and num_write members in the BIO structure has changed from unsigned long to uint64_t.

<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Given the pervasive nature of TLS extensions it is inadvisable to run OpenSSL without support for them. It also means that maintaining the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT option within the code is very invasive (and probably not well tested). Therefore, the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT option has been removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed support for the two export grade static DH ciphersuites EXP-DH-RSA-DES-CBC-SHA and EXP-DH-DSS-DES-CBC-SHA. These two ciphersuites were newly added (along with a number of other static DH ciphersuites) to 1.0.2. However the two export ones have <em>never</em> worked since they were introduced. It seems strange in any case to be adding new export ciphersuites, and given "logjam" it also does not seem correct to fix them.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Version negotiation has been rewritten. In particular SSLv23_method(), SSLv23_client_method() and SSLv23_server_method() have been deprecated, and turned into macros which simply call the new preferred function names TLS_method(), TLS_client_method() and TLS_server_method(). All new code should use the new names instead. Also as part of this change the ssl23.h header file has been removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>

Changes between 1.0.2s and 1.0.2t [10 Sep 2019]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">For built-in EC curves, ensure an EC_GROUP built from the curve name is used even when parsing explicit parameters, when loading a encoded key or calling <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecpkparameters()</code>/ <code>EC_GROUP_new_from_ecparameters()</code>. This prevents bypass of security hardening and performance gains, especially for curves with specialized EC_METHODs. By default, if a key encoded with explicit parameters is loaded and later encoded, the output is still encoded with explicit parameters, even if internally a "named" EC_GROUP is used for computation.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Nicola Tuveri</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Compute ECC cofactors if not provided during EC_GROUP construction. Before this change, EC_GROUP_set_generator would accept order and/or cofactor as NULL.

<p class="startli"><em>Billy Bob Brumley</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixed a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey. An attack is simple, if the first CMS_recipientInfo is valid but the second CMS_recipientInfo is chosen ciphertext. If the second recipientInfo decodes to PKCS #1 v1.5 form plaintext, the correct encryption key will be replaced by garbage, and the message cannot be decoded, but if the RSA decryption fails, the correct encryption key is used and the recipient will not notice the attack. As a work around for this potential attack the length of the decrypted key must be equal to the cipher default key length, in case the certificate is not given and all recipientInfo are tried out. The old behaviour can be re-enabled in the CMS code by setting the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2019-1563">CVE-2019-1563</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">0-byte record padding oracle</p>
<p class="startli">If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.</p>
<p class="startli">In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).</p>

<p class="startli">During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client.

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Read/write after SSL object in error state</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.</p>
<p class="startli">In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.</p>

Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.</p>

For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate problem.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Montgomery multiplication may produce incorrect results</p>
<p class="startli">There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.</p>

Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore, the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simultaneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.</p>

<p class="startli">Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarily used by the <code>PEM_write_bio*</code> family of functions.

<p class="startli">An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur.</p>

<p class="startli">In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value <code>i</code>. Later <code>bn_expand</code> is called with a value of <code>i * 4</code>. For large values of <code>i</code> this can result in <code>bn_expand</code> not allocating any memory because <code>i * 4</code> is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of <code>i</code>, the calculation <code>i * 4</code> could be a positive value smaller than <code>i</code>. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence.</p>
<p class="startli">All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments.

<p class="startli">Additionally the internal <code>doapr_outch</code> function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.</p>
<p class="startli">The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the <code>BIO_*printf</code> functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments.</p>

Changes between 1.0.2e and 1.0.2f [28 Jan 2016]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">DH small subgroups</p>
<p class="startli">Historically OpenSSL only ever generated DH parameters based on "safe" primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be "safe". Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not "safe" then an attacker could use this fact to find a peer's private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS server's private DH exponent if it's reusing the private DH exponent or it's using a static DH ciphersuite.</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL provides the option SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk.</p>
<p class="startli">The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a "q" parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact.</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.</p>

<p class="startli">There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients.

Changes between 1.0.2c and 1.0.2d [9 Jul 2015]</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Alternate chains certificate forgery</p>
<p class="startli">During certificate verification, OpenSSL will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first attempt to build such a chain fails. An error in the implementation of this logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">ClientHello sigalgs DoS fix</p>
<p class="startli">If a client connects to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 server and renegotiates with an invalid signature algorithms extension a NULL pointer dereference will occur. This can be exploited in a DoS attack against the server.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Stephen Henson and Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Multiblock corrupted pointer fix</p>
<p class="startli">OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the "multiblock" performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of "multiblock" can cause OpenSSL's internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen fix</p>
<p class="startli">The DTLSv1_listen function is intended to be stateless and processes the initial ClientHello from many peers. It is common for user code to loop over the call to DTLSv1_listen until a valid ClientHello is received with an associated cookie. A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listen means that state is preserved in the SSL object from one invocation to the next that can lead to a segmentation fault. Errors processing the initial ClientHello can trigger this scenario. An example of such an error could be that a DTLS1.0 only client is attempting to connect to a DTLS1.2 only server.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Handshake with unseeded PRNG fix</p>
<p class="startli">Under certain conditions an OpenSSL 1.0.2 client can complete a handshake with an unseeded PRNG. The conditions are:</p><ul>
<li>The client is on a platform where the PRNG has not been seeded automatically, and the user has not seeded manually</li>
<li>A protocol specific client method version has been used (i.e. not SSL_client_methodv23)</li>
<li>A ciphersuite is used that does not require additional random data from the PRNG beyond the initial ClientHello client random (e.g. PSK-RC4-SHA).</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">If the handshake succeeds then the client random that has been used will have been generated from a PRNG with insufficient entropy and therefore the output may be predictable.</p>
<p class="startli">For example using the following command with an unseeded openssl will succeed on an unpatched platform:</p>
<p class="startli">openssl s_client -psk 1a2b3c4d -tls1_2 -cipher PSK-RC4-SHA (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2015-0285">CVE-2015-0285</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth</p>
<p class="startli">A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the "no-ocsp" build time option are not affected.</p>

<p class="startli">An overflow can occur in MDC2_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.</p>

<p class="startli">If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will ultimately crash.</p>
<p class="startli">The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.</p>

<li><p class="startli">OOB write in BN_bn2dec()</p>
<p class="startli">The function BN_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN_div_word(). This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source.

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Pointer arithmetic undefined behaviour</p>
<p class="startli">Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic</p>
<p class="startli">A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: "p + len &gt; limit"</p>
<p class="startli">Where "p" points to some malloc'd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE</p>
<p class="startli">"len" here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message).</p>
<p class="startli">The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that "p + len" is only well defined where len &lt;= SIZE. Therefore, the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour.</p>
<p class="startli">For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for "p" such that "p + len" actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len &lt; limit.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing</p>
<p class="startli">Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">DTLS buffered message DoS</p>
<p class="startli">In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore, the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simultaneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Matt Caswell</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">DTLS replay protection DoS</p>
<p class="startli">A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection "window" before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Certificate message OOB reads</p>
<p class="startli">In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.</p>
<p class="startli">The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.</p>

<p class="startli">A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI.</p>

The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Kurt Roeckx</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix EVP_EncodeUpdate overflow</p>
<p class="startli">An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.</p>
<p class="startli">Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarily used by the <code>PEM_write_bio*</code> family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications, so any application which processes data from an untrusted source and outputs it as a PEM file should be considered vulnerable to this issue. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may also be vulnerable.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fix EVP_EncryptUpdate overflow</p>
<p class="startli">An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur.</p>

<p class="startli">When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio() a short invalid encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting memory.</p>
<p class="startli">Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions is affected. The memory based functions such as d2i_X509() are <em>not</em> affected. Since the memory based functions are used by the TLS library, TLS applications are not affected.</p>

<p class="startli">Users should use SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user instead. Note that in SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user, caller must free the returned value. Note also that even though configuring the SRP seed attempts to hide invalid usernames by continuing the handshake with fake credentials, this behaviour is not constant time and no strong guarantees are made that the handshake is indistinguishable from that of a valid user.

<li><p class="startli">Fix BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn NULL pointer deref/heap corruption</p>
<p class="startli">In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value <code>i</code>. Later <code>bn_expand</code> is called with a value of <code>i * 4</code>. For large values of <code>i</code> this can result in <code>bn_expand</code> not allocating any memory because <code>i * 4</code> is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of <code>i</code>, the calculation <code>i * 4</code> could be a positive value smaller than <code>i</code>. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence.</p>
<p class="startli">All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.</p>
<p class="startli">This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Guido Vranken. (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2016-0797">CVE-2016-0797</a>)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fix memory issues in <code>BIO_*printf</code> functions</p>
<p class="startli">The internal <code>fmtstr</code> function used in processing a "%s" format string in the <code>BIO_*printf</code> functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally the internal <code>doapr_outch</code> function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.</p>
<p class="startli">The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the <code>BIO_*printf</code> functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments.</p>
<p class="startli">Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.</p>

Fix this by changing the value of SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 to 0x10000000L Any application which was previously compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.1 or 1.0.1a headers and which cares about SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 will need to be recompiled as a result. Letting be results in inability to disable specifically TLS 1.1 and in client context, in unlike event, limit maximum offered version to TLS 1.0 [see below].</p>

<li><p class="startli">In order to ensure interoperability SSL_OP_NO_protocolX does not disable just protocol X, but all protocols above X <em>if</em> there are protocols <em>below</em> X still enabled. In more practical terms it means that if application wants to disable TLS1.0 in favor of TLS1.1 and above, it's not sufficient to pass <code>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1</code>, one has to pass <code>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2</code>.

<p class="startli">When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service attack.

<li><p class="startli">To cater for systems that provide a pointer-based thread ID rather than numeric, deprecate the current numeric thread ID mechanism and replace it with a structure and associated callback type. This mechanism allows a numeric "hash" to be extracted from a thread ID in either case, and on platforms where pointers are larger than 'long', mixing is done to help ensure the numeric 'hash' is usable even if it can't be guaranteed unique. The default mechanism is to use "&amp;errno" as a pointer-based thread ID to distinguish between threads.</p>
<p class="startli">Applications that want to provide their own thread IDs should now use CRYPTO_THREADID_set_callback() to register a callback that will call either CRYPTO_THREADID_set_numeric() or CRYPTO_THREADID_set_pointer().</p>
<p class="startli">Note that ERR_remove_state() is now deprecated, because it is tied to the assumption that thread IDs are numeric. ERR_remove_state(0) to free the current thread's error state should be replaced by ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL).</p>
<p class="startli">(This new approach replaces the functions CRYPTO_set_idptr_callback(), CRYPTO_get_idptr_callback(), and CRYPTO_thread_idptr() that existed in OpenSSL 0.9.9-dev between June 2006 and August 2008. Also, if an application was previously providing a numeric thread callback that was inappropriate for distinguishing threads, then uniqueness might have been obtained with &amp;errno that happened immediately in the intermediate development versions of OpenSSL; this is no longer the case, the numeric thread callback will now override the automatic use of &amp;errno.)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Implement Opaque PRF Input TLS extension as specified in draft-rescorla-tls-opaque-prf-input-00.txt. Since this is not an official specification yet and no extension type assignment by IANA exists, this extension (for now) will have to be explicitly enabled when building OpenSSL by providing the extension number to use. For example, specify an option </p><pre class="fragment">    -DTLSEXT_TYPE_opaque_prf_input=0x9527
</pre><p> to the "config" or "Configure" script to enable the extension, assuming extension number 0x9527 (which is a completely arbitrary and unofficial assignment based on the MD5 hash of the Internet Draft). Note that by doing so, you potentially lose interoperability with other TLS implementations since these might be using the same extension number for other purposes.</p>
<p class="startli">SSL_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input(ssl, src, len) is used to set the opaque PRF input value to use in the handshake. This will create an internal copy of the length-'len' string at 'src', and will return non-zero for success.</p>
<p class="startli">To get more control and flexibility, provide a callback function by using </p><pre class="fragment">    SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input_callback(ctx, cb)
    SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input_callback_arg(ctx, arg)
</pre><p> where </p><pre class="fragment">    int (*cb)(SSL *, void *peerinput, size_t len, void *arg);
    void *arg;
</pre><p> Callback function 'cb' will be called in handshakes, and is expected to use SSL_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input() as appropriate. Argument 'arg' is for application purposes (the value as given to SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input_callback_arg() will directly be provided to the callback function). The callback function has to return non-zero to report success: usually 1 to use opaque PRF input just if possible, or 2 to enforce use of the opaque PRF input. In the latter case, the library will abort the handshake if opaque PRF input is not successfully negotiated.</p>
<p class="startli">Arguments 'peerinput' and 'len' given to the callback function will always be NULL and 0 in the case of a client. A server will see the client's opaque PRF input through these variables if available (NULL and 0 otherwise). Note that if the server provides an opaque PRF input, the length must be the same as the length of the client's opaque PRF input.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that the callback function will only be called when creating a new session (session resumption can resume whatever was previously negotiated), and will not be called in SSL 2.0 handshakes; thus, SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2) or SSL_set_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2) is especially recommended for applications that need to enforce opaque PRF input.</p>

<p class="startli">This means that you can now say, e.g., "PSK:-PSK:HIGH" to enable the same ciphersuites as with "HIGH" alone, but in a specific order where the PSK ciphersuites come first (since they are the most recently disabled ciphersuites when "HIGH" is parsed).</p>
<p class="startli">Also, change ssl_create_cipher_list() (using this new functionality) such that between otherwise identical ciphersuites, ephemeral ECDH is preferred over ephemeral DH in the default order.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change ssl_create_cipher_list() so that it automatically arranges the ciphersuites in reasonable order before starting to process the rule string. Thus, the definition for "DEFAULT" (SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST) now is just "ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL", but remains equivalent to <code>"AES:ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:+aECDH:+kRSA:+RC4:@STRENGTH"</code>. This makes it much easier to arrive at a reasonable default order in applications for which anonymous ciphers are OK (meaning that you can't actually use DEFAULT).</p>

<li><p class="startli">Split the SSL/TLS algorithm mask (as used for ciphersuite string processing) into multiple integers instead of setting "SSL_MKEY_MASK" bits, "SSL_AUTH_MASK" bits, "SSL_ENC_MASK", "SSL_MAC_MASK", and "SSL_SSL_MASK" bits all in a single integer. (These masks as well as the individual bit definitions are hidden away into the non-exported interface ssl/ssl_locl.h, so this change to the definition of the SSL_CIPHER structure shouldn't affect applications.) This give us more bits for each of these categories, so there is no longer a need to coagulate AES128 and AES256 into a single algorithm bit, and to coagulate Camellia128 and Camellia256 into a single algorithm bit, which has led to all kinds of kludges.</p>
<p class="startli">Thus, among other things, the kludge introduced in 0.9.7m and 0.9.8e for masking out AES256 independently of AES128 or masking out Camellia256 independently of AES256 is not needed here in 0.9.9.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Initial incomplete changes to avoid need for function casts in OpenSSL some compilers (gcc 4.2 and later) reject their use. Safestack is reimplemented. Update ASN1 to avoid use of legacy functions.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Win32/64 targets are linked with Winsock2.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add an X509_CRL_METHOD structure to allow CRL processing to be redirected to external functions. This can be used to increase CRL handling efficiency especially when CRLs are very large by (for example) storing the CRL revoked certificates in a database.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Overhaul of by_dir code. Add support for dynamic loading of CRLs so new CRLs added to a directory can be used. New command line option -verify_return_error to s_client and s_server. This causes real errors to be returned by the verify callback instead of carrying on no matter what. This reflects the way a "real world" verify callback would behave.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Partial support for Issuing Distribution Point CRL extension. CRLs partitioned by DP are handled but no indirect CRL or reason partitioning (yet). Complete overhaul of CRL handling: now the most suitable CRL is selected via a scoring technique which handles IDP and AKID in CRLs.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New X509_STORE_CTX callbacks lookup_crls() and lookup_certs() which will ultimately be used for all verify operations: this will remove the X509_STORE dependency on certificate verification and allow alternative lookup methods. X509_STORE based implementations of these two callbacks.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Allow multiple CRLs to exist in an X509_STORE with matching issuer names. Modify get_crl() to find a valid (unexpired) CRL if possible.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New function X509_CRL_match() to check if two CRLs are identical. Normally this would be called X509_CRL_cmp() but that name is already used by a function that just compares CRL issuer names. Cache several CRL extensions in X509_CRL structure and cache CRLDP in X509.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Store a "canonical" representation of X509_NAME structure (ASN1 Name) this maps equivalent X509_NAME structures into a consistent structure. Name comparison can then be performed rapidly using memcmp().</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">During PKCS7 signing pass the PKCS7 SignerInfo structure to the EVP_PKEY_METHOD before and after signing via the EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_SIGN ctrl. It can then customise the structure before and/or after signing if necessary.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New function OBJ_add_sigid() to allow application defined signature OIDs to be added to OpenSSLs internal tables. New function OBJ_sigid_free() to free up any added signature OIDs.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New functions EVP_CIPHER_do_all(), EVP_CIPHER_do_all_sorted(), EVP_MD_do_all() and EVP_MD_do_all_sorted() to enumerate internal digest and cipher tables. New options added to openssl utility: list-message-digest-algorithms and list-cipher-algorithms.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the array representation of binary polynomials: the list of degrees of non-zero coefficients is now terminated with -1. Previously it was terminated with 0, which was also part of the value; thus, the array representation was not applicable to polynomials where t^0 has coefficient zero. This change makes the array representation useful in a more general context.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Douglas Stebila</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Various modifications and fixes to SSL/TLS cipher string handling. For ECC, the code now distinguishes between fixed ECDH with RSA certificates on the one hand and with ECDSA certificates on the other hand, since these are separate ciphersuites. The unused code for Fortezza ciphersuites has been removed.</p>
<p class="startli">For consistency with EDH, ephemeral ECDH is now called "EECDH" (not "ECDHE"). For consistency with the code for DH certificates, use of ECDH certificates is now considered ECDH authentication, not RSA or ECDSA authentication (the latter is merely the CA's signing algorithm and not actively used in the protocol).</p>
<p class="startli">The temporary ciphersuite alias "ECCdraft" is no longer available, and ECC ciphersuites are no longer excluded from "ALL" and "DEFAULT". The following aliases now exist for RFC 4492 ciphersuites, most of these by analogy with the DH case: </p><pre class="fragment">    kECDHr   - ECDH cert, signed with RSA
    kECDHe   - ECDH cert, signed with ECDSA
    kECDH    - ECDH cert (signed with either RSA or ECDSA)
    kEECDH   - ephemeral ECDH
    ECDH     - ECDH cert or ephemeral ECDH

    aECDH    - ECDH cert
    aECDSA   - ECDSA cert
    ECDSA    - ECDSA cert

    AECDH    - anonymous ECDH
    EECDH    - non-anonymous ephemeral ECDH (equivalent to "kEECDH:-AECDH")

<li><p class="startli">Initial support for PKCS#5 v2.0 PRFs other than default SHA1 HMAC. Reorganize PBE internals to lookup from a static table using NIDs, add support for HMAC PBE OID translation. Add a EVP_CIPHER ctrl: EVP_CTRL_PBE_PRF_NID this allows a cipher to specify an alternative PRF which will be automatically used with PBES2.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Replace the algorithm specific calls to generate keys in "req" with the new API.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Update PKCS#7 enveloped data routines to use new API. This is now supported by any public key method supporting the encrypt operation. A ctrl is added to allow the public key algorithm to examine or modify the PKCS#7 RecipientInfo structure if it needs to: for RSA this is a no op.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a ctrl to asn1 method to allow a public key algorithm to express a default digest type to use. In most cases this will be SHA1 but some algorithms (such as GOST) need to specify an alternative digest. The return value indicates how strong the preference is 1 means optional and 2 is mandatory (that is it is the only supported type). Modify ASN1_item_sign() to accept a NULL digest argument to indicate it should use the default md. Update openssl utilities to use the default digest type for signing if it is not explicitly indicated.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Use OID cross reference table in ASN1_sign() and ASN1_verify(). New EVP_MD flag EVP_MD_FLAG_PKEY_METHOD_SIGNATURE. This uses the relevant signing method from the key type. This effectively removes the link between digests and public key types.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add an OID cross reference table and utility functions. Its purpose is to translate between signature OIDs such as SHA1WithrsaEncryption and SHA1, rsaEncryption. This will allow some of the algorithm specific hackery needed to use the correct OID to be removed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Remove algorithm specific dependencies when setting PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO structures for PKCS7_sign(). They are now set up by the relevant public key ASN1 method.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The code that handled flushing of data in SSL/TLS originally used the BIO_CTRL_INFO ctrl to see if any data was pending first. This caused the problem outlined in PR#1949. The fix suggested there however can trigger problems with buggy BIO_CTRL_WPENDING (e.g. some versions of Apache). So instead simplify the code to flush unconditionally. This should be fine since flushing with no data to flush is a no op.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Modify compression code so it frees up structures without using the ex_data callbacks. This works around a problem where some applications call CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data() before application exit (e.g. when restarting) then use compression (e.g. SSL with compression) later. This results in significant per-connection memory leaks and has caused some security issues including CVE-2008-1678 and CVE-2009-4355.</p>

<li><p class="startli">If client attempts to renegotiate and doesn't support RI respond with a no_renegotiation alert as required by RFC5746. Some renegotiating TLS clients will continue a connection gracefully when they receive the alert. Unfortunately OpenSSL mishandled this alert and would hang waiting for a server hello which it will never receive. Now we treat a received no_renegotiation alert as a fatal error. This is because applications requesting a renegotiation might well expect it to succeed and would have no code in place to handle the server denying it so the only safe thing to do is to terminate the connection.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Add RFC4507 support to OpenSSL. This includes the corrections in RFC4507bis. The encrypted ticket format is an encrypted encoded SSL_SESSION structure, that way new session features are automatically supported.</p>
<p class="startli">If a client application caches session in an SSL_SESSION structure support is transparent because tickets are now stored in the encoded SSL_SESSION.</p>
<p class="startli">The SSL_CTX structure automatically generates keys for ticket protection in servers so again support should be possible with no application modification.</p>
<p class="startli">If a client or server wishes to disable RFC4507 support then the option SSL_OP_NO_TICKET can be set.</p>
<p class="startli">Add a TLS extension debugging callback to allow the contents of any client or server extensions to be examined.</p>
<p class="startli">This work was sponsored by Google.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add initial support for TLS extensions, specifically for the server_name extension so far. The SSL_SESSION, SSL_CTX, and SSL data structures now have new members for a hostname. The SSL data structure has an additional member <code>SSL_CTX *initial_ctx</code> so that new sessions can be stored in that context to allow for session resumption, even after the SSL has been switched to a new SSL_CTX in reaction to a client's server_name extension.</p>

This allows testing the HostName extension for a specific single hostname ('-cert' and '-key' remain fallbacks for handshakes without HostName negotiation). If the unrecognized_name alert has to be sent, this by default is a warning; it becomes fatal with the '-servername_fatal' option.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>KISA, Bodo Moeller</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Mitigate branch prediction attacks, which can be practical if a single processor is shared, allowing a spy process to extract information. For detailed background information, see <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/039">http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/039</a> (O. Aciicmez, S. Gueron, J.-P. Seifert, "New Branch Prediction Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL
   and Necessary Software Countermeasures"). The core of the change are new versions BN_div_no_branch() and BN_mod_inverse_no_branch() of BN_div() and BN_mod_inverse(), respectively, which are slower, but avoid the security-relevant conditional branches. These are automatically called by BN_div() and BN_mod_inverse() if the flag BN_FLG_CONSTTIME is set for one of the input BIGNUMs. Also, BN_is_bit_set() has been changed to remove a conditional branch.</p>
<p class="startli">BN_FLG_CONSTTIME is the new name for the previous BN_FLG_EXP_CONSTTIME flag, since it now affects more than just modular exponentiation. (Since OpenSSL 0.9.7h, setting this flag in the exponent causes BN_mod_exp_mont() to use the alternative implementation in BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime().) The old name remains as a deprecated alias.</p>
<p class="startli">Similarly, RSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME is replaced by a more general RSA_FLAG_NO_CONSTTIME flag since the RSA implementation now uses constant-time implementations for more than just exponentiation. Here too the old name is kept as a deprecated alias.</p>
<p class="startli">BN_BLINDING_new() will now use BN_dup() for the modulus so that the BN_BLINDING structure gets an independent copy of the modulus. This means that the previous <code>BIGNUM *m</code> argument to BN_BLINDING_new() and to BN_BLINDING_create_param() now essentially becomes <code>const BIGNUM *m</code>, although we can't actually change this in the header file before 0.9.9. It allows RSA_setup_blinding() to use BN_with_flags() on the modulus to enable BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Matthew D Wood (Intel Corp)</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">In the SSL/TLS server implementation, be strict about session ID context matching (which matters if an application uses a single external cache for different purposes). Previously, out-of-context reuse was forbidden only if SSL_VERIFY_PEER was set. This did ensure strict client verification, but meant that, with applications using a single external cache for quite different requirements, clients could circumvent ciphersuite restrictions for a given session ID context by starting a session in a different context.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Since AES128 and AES256 (and similarly Camellia128 and Camellia256) share a single mask bit in the logic of ssl/ssl_ciph.c, the code for masking out disabled ciphers needs a kludge to work properly if AES128 is available and AES256 isn't (or if Camellia128 is available and Camellia256 isn't).</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, Google Security Team</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Since 0.9.8b, ciphersuite strings naming explicit ciphersuites match only those. Before that, "AES256-SHA" would be interpreted as a pattern and match "AES128-SHA" too (since AES128-SHA got the same strength classification in 0.9.7h) as we currently only have a single AES bit in the ciphersuite description bitmap. That change, however, also applied to ciphersuite strings such as "RC4-MD5" that intentionally matched multiple ciphersuites &ndash; namely, SSL 2.0 ciphersuites in addition to the more common ones from SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0.</p>
<p class="startli">So we change the selection algorithm again: Naming an explicit ciphersuite selects this one ciphersuite, and any other similar ciphersuite (same bitmap) from <em>other</em> protocol versions. Thus, "RC4-MD5" again will properly select both the SSL 2.0 ciphersuite and the SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 ciphersuite.</p>
<p class="startli">Since SSL 2.0 does not have any ciphersuites for which the 128/256 bit distinction would be relevant, this works for now. The proper fix will be to use different bits for AES128 and AES256, which would have avoided the problems from the beginning; however, bits are scarce, so we can only do this in a new release (not just a patchlevel) when we can change the SSL_CIPHER definition to split the single 'unsigned long mask' bitmap into multiple values to extend the available space.</p>

<li><p class="startli">An audit of the BIGNUM code is underway, for which debugging code is enabled when BN_DEBUG is defined. This makes stricter enforcements on what is considered valid when processing BIGNUMs, and causes execution to assert() when a problem is discovered. If BN_DEBUG_RAND is defined, further steps are taken to deliberately pollute unused data in BIGNUM structures to try and expose faulty code further on. For now, openssl will (in its default mode of operation) continue to tolerate the inconsistent forms that it has tolerated in the past, but authors and packagers should consider trying openssl and their own applications when compiled with these debugging symbols defined. It will help highlight potential bugs in their own code, and will improve the test coverage for OpenSSL itself. At some point, these tighter rules will become openssl's default to improve maintainability, though the assert()s and other overheads will remain only in debugging configurations. See bn.h for more details.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Geoff Thorpe</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Because of the callback-based approach for implementing LHASH as a template type, lh_insert() adds opaque objects to hash-tables and lh_doall() or lh_doall_arg() are typically used with a destructor callback to clean up those corresponding objects before destroying the hash table (and losing the object pointers). So some over-zealous constifications in LHASH have been relaxed so that lh_insert() does not take (nor store) the objects as "const" and the <code>lh_doall[_arg]</code> callback wrappers are not prototyped to have "const" restrictions on the object pointers they are given (and so aren't required to cast them away any more).</p>

   can be added using this API to created arbitrary PKCS#12
   files while avoiding the low-level API.

   New options to PKCS12_create(), key or cert can be NULL and
   will then be omitted from the output file. The encryption
   algorithm NIDs can be set to -1 for no encryption, the mac
   iteration count can be set to 0 to omit the mac.

   Enhance pkcs12 utility by making the -nokeys and -nocerts
   options work when creating a PKCS#12 file. New option -nomac
   to omit the mac, NONE can be set for an encryption algorithm.
   New code is modified to use the enhanced PKCS12_create()
   instead of the low-level API.

 * Extend ASN1 encoder to support indefinite length constructed
   encoding. This can output sequences tags and octet strings in

   enable it).

   As binary polynomials are represented as BIGNUMs, various members
   of the EC_GROUP and EC_POINT data structures can be shared
   between the implementations for prime fields and binary fields;
   the above &lt;tt&gt;..._GF2m functions&lt;/tt&gt; (except for EX_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m)
   are essentially identical to their &lt;tt&gt;..._GFp&lt;/tt&gt; counterparts.
   (For simplicity, the &lt;tt&gt;..._GFp&lt;/tt&gt; prefix has been dropped from
   various internal method names.)

   An internal 'field_div' method (similar to 'field_mul' and
   'field_sqr') has been added; this is used only for binary fields.

   &lt;em&gt;Sheueling Chang Shantz and Douglas Stebila (Sun Microsystems Laboratories)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Optionally dispatch EC_POINT_mul(), EC_POINT_precompute_mult()
   through methods ('mul', 'precompute_mult').

   The generic implementations (now internally called 'ec_wNAF_mul'
   and 'ec_wNAF_precomputed_mult') remain the default if these
   methods are undefined.

   &lt;em&gt;Sheueling Chang Shantz and Douglas Stebila (Sun Microsystems Laboratories)&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function EC_GROUP_get_degree, which is defined through
   EC_METHOD.  For curves over prime fields, this returns the bit
   length of the modulus.

   &lt;em&gt;Sheueling Chang Shantz and Douglas Stebila (Sun Microsystems Laboratories)&lt;/em&gt;

 * New functions EC_GROUP_dup, EC_POINT_dup.
   (These simply call ..._new  and ..._copy).

   &lt;em&gt;Sheueling Chang Shantz and Douglas Stebila (Sun Microsystems Laboratories)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add binary polynomial arithmetic software in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c.
   Polynomials are represented as BIGNUMs (where the sign bit is not
   used) in the following functions [macros]:
@iverbatim 
    BN_GF2m_add
    BN_GF2m_sub             [= BN_GF2m_add]
    BN_GF2m_mod             [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_arr]
    BN_GF2m_mod_mul         [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_mul_arr]
    BN_GF2m_mod_sqr         [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_sqr_arr]
    BN_GF2m_mod_inv
    BN_GF2m_mod_exp         [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_exp_arr]
    BN_GF2m_mod_sqrt        [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_sqrt_arr]
    BN_GF2m_mod_solve_quad  [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_solve_quad_arr]
    BN_GF2m_cmp             [= BN_ucmp]
@endiverbatim
   (Note that only the 'mod' functions are actually for fields GF(2^m).
   BN_GF2m_add() is misnomer, but this is for the sake of consistency.)

   For some functions, an the irreducible polynomial defining a
   field can be given as an 'unsigned int[]' with strictly
   decreasing elements giving the indices of those bits that are set;
   i.e., p[] represents the polynomial
           f(t) = t^p[0] + t^p[1] + ... + t^p[k]
   where
           p[0] &gt; p[1] &gt; ... &gt; p[k] = 0.
   This applies to the following functions:
@iverbatim 
    BN_GF2m_mod_arr
    BN_GF2m_mod_mul_arr
    BN_GF2m_mod_sqr_arr
    BN_GF2m_mod_inv_arr        [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_inv]
    BN_GF2m_mod_div_arr        [wrapper for BN_GF2m_mod_div]
    BN_GF2m_mod_exp_arr
    BN_GF2m_mod_sqrt_arr
    BN_GF2m_mod_solve_quad_arr
    BN_GF2m_poly2arr
    BN_GF2m_arr2poly
@endiverbatim
   Conversion can be performed by the following functions:
@iverbatim 
    BN_GF2m_poly2arr
    BN_GF2m_arr2poly
@endiverbatim
   bntest.c has additional tests for binary polynomial arithmetic.

   Two implementations for BN_GF2m_mod_div() are available.
   The default algorithm simply uses BN_GF2m_mod_inv() and
   BN_GF2m_mod_mul().  The alternative algorithm is compiled in only
   if OPENSSL_SUN_GF2M_DIV is defined (patent pending; read the
   copyright notice in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c before enabling it).

   &lt;em&gt;Sheueling Chang Shantz and Douglas Stebila (Sun Microsystems Laboratories)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add new error code 'ERR_R_DISABLED' that can be used when some
   functionality is disabled at compile-time.

   *Douglas Stebila &lt;douglas.stebila@sun.com&gt;*

 * Change default behaviour of 'openssl asn1parse' so that more
   information is visible when viewing, e.g., a certificate:

   Modify asn1_parse2 (crypto/asn1/asn1_par.c) so that in non-'dump'
   mode the content of non-printable OCTET STRINGs is output in a
   style similar to INTEGERs, but with '[HEX DUMP]' prepended to
   avoid the appearance of a printable string.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Add 'asn1_flag' and 'asn1_form' member to EC_GROUP with access
   functions
           EC_GROUP_set_asn1_flag()
           EC_GROUP_get_asn1_flag()
           EC_GROUP_set_point_conversion_form()
           EC_GROUP_get_point_conversion_form()
   These control ASN1 encoding details:
   - Curves (i.e., groups) are encoded explicitly unless asn1_flag
     has been set to OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE.
   - Points are encoded in uncompressed form by default; options for
     asn1_for are as for point2oct, namely
           POINT_CONVERSION_COMPRESSED
           POINT_CONVERSION_UNCOMPRESSED
           POINT_CONVERSION_HYBRID

   Also add 'seed' and 'seed_len' members to EC_GROUP with access
   functions
           EC_GROUP_set_seed()
           EC_GROUP_get0_seed()
           EC_GROUP_get_seed_len()
   This is used only for ASN1 purposes (so far).

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Add 'field_type' member to EC_METHOD, which holds the NID
   of the appropriate field type OID.  The new function
   EC_METHOD_get_field_type() returns this value.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Add functions
           EC_POINT_point2bn()
           EC_POINT_bn2point()
           EC_POINT_point2hex()
           EC_POINT_hex2point()
   providing useful interfaces to EC_POINT_point2oct() and
   EC_POINT_oct2point().

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Change internals of the EC library so that the functions
           EC_GROUP_set_generator()
           EC_GROUP_get_generator()
           EC_GROUP_get_order()
           EC_GROUP_get_cofactor()
   are implemented directly in crypto/ec/ec_lib.c and not dispatched
   to methods, which would lead to unnecessary code duplication when
   adding different types of curves.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt; with input by Bodo Moeller*

 * Implement compute_wNAF (crypto/ec/ec_mult.c) without BIGNUM
   arithmetic, and such that modified wNAFs are generated
   (which avoid length expansion in many cases).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a function EC_GROUP_check_discriminant() (defined via
   EC_METHOD) that verifies that the curve discriminant is non-zero.

   Add a function EC_GROUP_check() that makes some sanity tests
   on a EC_GROUP, its generator and order.  This includes
   EC_GROUP_check_discriminant().

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Add ECDSA in new directory crypto/ecdsa/.

   Add applications 'openssl ecparam' and 'openssl ecdsa'
   (these are based on 'openssl dsaparam' and 'openssl dsa').

   ECDSA support is also included in various other files across the
   library.  Most notably,
   - 'openssl req' now has a '-newkey ecdsa:file' option;
   - EVP_PKCS82PKEY (crypto/evp/evp_pkey.c) now can handle ECDSA;
   - X509_PUBKEY_get (crypto/asn1/x_pubkey.c) and
     d2i_PublicKey (crypto/asn1/d2i_pu.c) have been modified to make
     them suitable for ECDSA where domain parameters must be
     extracted before the specific public key;
   - ECDSA engine support has been added.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Include some named elliptic curves, and add OIDs from X9.62,
   SECG, and WAP/WTLS.  Each curve can be obtained from the new
   function
           EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name(),
   and the list of available named curves can be obtained with
           EC_get_builtin_curves().
   Also add a 'curve_name' member to EC_GROUP objects, which can be
   accessed via
           EC_GROUP_set_curve_name()
           EC_GROUP_get_curve_name()

   *Nils Larsch &lt;larsch@trustcenter.de, Bodo Moeller*

 * Remove a few calls to bn_wexpand() in BN_sqr() (the one in there
   was actually never needed) and in BN_mul().  The removal in BN_mul()
   required a small change in bn_mul_part_recursive() and the addition
   of the functions bn_cmp_part_words(), bn_sub_part_words() and
   bn_add_part_words(), which do the same thing as bn_cmp_words(),
   bn_sub_words() and bn_add_words() except they take arrays with
   differing sizes.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md135 Changes between 0.9.7l and 0.9.7m  [23 Feb 2007]

 * Cleanse PEM buffers before freeing them since they may contain
   sensitive data.

   *Benjamin Bennett &lt;ben@psc.edu&gt;*

 * Include "!eNULL" in SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST to make sure that
   a ciphersuite string such as "DEFAULT:RSA" cannot enable
   authentication-only ciphersuites.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Since AES128 and AES256 share a single mask bit in the logic of
   ssl/ssl_ciph.c, the code for masking out disabled ciphers needs a
   kludge to work properly if AES128 is available and AES256 isn't.

   &lt;em&gt;Victor Duchovni&lt;/em&gt;

 * Expand security boundary to match 1.1.1 module.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Remove redundant features: hash file source, editing of test vectors
   modify fipsld to use external fips_premain.c signature.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New perl script mkfipsscr.pl to create shell scripts or batch files to
   run algorithm test programs.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make algorithm test programs more tolerant of whitespace.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Have SSL/TLS server implementation tolerate "mismatched" record
   protocol version while receiving ClientHello even if the
   ClientHello is fragmented.  (The server can't insist on the
   particular protocol version it has chosen before the ServerHello
   message has informed the client about his choice.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Load error codes if they are not already present instead of using a
   static variable. This allows them to be cleanly unloaded and reloaded.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md136 Changes between 0.9.7k and 0.9.7l  [28 Sep 2006]

 * Introduce limits to prevent malicious keys being able to
   cause a denial of service.  (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-2940">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-2940</a>" &gt;CVE-2006-2940&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix ASN.1 parsing of certain invalid structures that can result
   in a denial of service.  (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-2937">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-2937</a>" &gt;CVE-2006-2937&lt;/a&gt;)  [Steve Henson]

 * Fix buffer overflow in SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function.
   (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-3738">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-3738</a>" &gt;CVE-2006-3738&lt;/a&gt;) [Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, Google Security Team]

 * Fix SSL client code which could crash if connecting to a
   malicious SSLv2 server.  (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-4343">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-4343</a>" &gt;CVE-2006-4343&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, Google Security Team&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change ciphersuite string processing so that an explicit
   ciphersuite selects this one ciphersuite (so that "AES256-SHA"
   will no longer include "AES128-SHA"), and any other similar
   ciphersuite (same bitmap) from &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; protocol versions (so that
   "RC4-MD5" will still include both the SSL 2.0 ciphersuite and the
   SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 ciphersuite).  This is a backport combining
   changes from 0.9.8b and 0.9.8d.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md137 Changes between 0.9.7j and 0.9.7k  [05 Sep 2006]

 * Avoid PKCS #1 v1.5 signature attack discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher
   (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-4339">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2006-4339</a>" &gt;CVE-2006-4339&lt;/a&gt;)  [Ben Laurie and Google Security Team]

 * Change the Unix randomness entropy gathering to use poll() when
   possible instead of select(), since the latter has some
   undesirable limitations.

   &lt;em&gt;Darryl Miles via Richard Levitte and Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disable rogue ciphersuites:

   - SSLv2 0x08 0x00 0x80 ("RC4-64-MD5")
   - SSLv3/TLSv1 0x00 0x61 ("EXP1024-RC2-CBC-MD5")
   - SSLv3/TLSv1 0x00 0x60 ("EXP1024-RC4-MD5")

   The latter two were purportedly from
   draft-ietf-tls-56-bit-ciphersuites-0[01].txt, but do not really
   appear there.

   Also deactivate the remaining ciphersuites from
   draft-ietf-tls-56-bit-ciphersuites-01.txt.  These are just as
   unofficial, and the ID has long expired.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix RSA blinding Heisenbug (problems sometimes occurred on
   dual-core machines) and other potential thread-safety issues.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md138 Changes between 0.9.7i and 0.9.7j  [04 May 2006]

 * Adapt fipsld and the build system to link against the validated FIPS
   module in FIPS mode.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fixes for VC++ 2005 build under Windows.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add new Windows build target VC-32-GMAKE for VC++. This uses GNU make
   from a Windows bash shell such as MSYS. It is autodetected from the
   "config" script when run from a VC++ environment. Modify standard VC++
   build to use fipscanister.o from the GNU make build.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md139 Changes between 0.9.7h and 0.9.7i  [14 Oct 2005]

 * Wrapped the definition of EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE in a #ifdef OPENSSL_FIPS.
   The value now differs depending on if you build for FIPS or not.
   BEWARE!  A program linked with a shared FIPSed libcrypto can't be
   safely run with a non-FIPSed libcrypto, as it may crash because of
   the difference induced by this change.

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md140 Changes between 0.9.7g and 0.9.7h  [11 Oct 2005]

 * Remove the functionality of SSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING
   (part of SSL_OP_ALL).  This option used to disable the
   countermeasure against man-in-the-middle protocol-version
   rollback in the SSL 2.0 server implementation, which is a bad
   idea.  (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2005-2969">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2005-2969</a>" &gt;CVE-2005-2969&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Yutaka Oiwa (Research Center
   for Information Security, National Institute of Advanced Industrial
   Science and Technology [AIST, Japan)]&lt;/em&gt;

 * Minimal support for X9.31 signatures and PSS padding modes. This is
   mainly for FIPS compliance and not fully integrated at this stage.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * For DSA signing, unless DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME is set, perform
   the exponentiation using a fixed-length exponent.  (Otherwise,
   the information leaked through timing could expose the secret key
   after many signatures; cf. Bleichenbacher's attack on DSA with
   biased k.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make a new fixed-window mod_exp implementation the default for
   RSA, DSA, and DH private-key operations so that the sequence of
   squares and multiplies and the memory access pattern are
   independent of the particular secret key.  This will mitigate
   cache-timing and potential related attacks.

   BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime() is the new exponentiation implementation,
   and this is automatically used by BN_mod_exp_mont() if the new flag
   BN_FLG_EXP_CONSTTIME is set for the exponent.  RSA, DSA, and DH
   will use this BN flag for private exponents unless the flag
   RSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME, DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME, or
   DH_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME, respectively, is set.

   &lt;em&gt;Matthew D Wood (Intel Corp), with some changes by Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the client implementation for SSLv23_method() and
   SSLv23_client_method() so that is uses the SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0
   Client Hello message format if the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 option is set.
   (Previously, the SSL 2.0 backwards compatible Client Hello
   message format would be used even with SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for smime-type MIME parameter in S/MIME messages which some
   clients need.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function BN_MONT_CTX_set_locked() to set montgomery parameters in
   a threadsafe manner. Modify rsa code to use new function and add calls
   to dsa and dh code (which had race conditions before).

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Include the fixed error library code in the C error file definitions
   instead of fixing them up at runtime. This keeps the error code
   structures constant.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md141 Changes between 0.9.7f and 0.9.7g  [11 Apr 2005]

[NB: OpenSSL 0.9.7h and later 0.9.7 patch levels were released after
OpenSSL 0.9.8.]

 * Fixes for newer kerberos headers. NB: the casts are needed because
   the 'length' field is signed on one version and unsigned on another
   with no (?) obvious way to tell the difference, without these VC++
   complains. Also the "definition" of FAR (blank) is no longer included
   nor is the error ENOMEM. KRB5_PRIVATE has to be set to 1 to pick up
   some needed definitions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Undo Cygwin change.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added support for proxy certificates according to RFC 3820.
   Because they may be a security thread to unaware applications,
   they must be explicitly allowed in run-time.  See
   docs/HOWTO/proxy_certificates.txt for further information.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md142 Changes between 0.9.7e and 0.9.7f  [22 Mar 2005]

 * Use (SSL_RANDOM_VALUE - 4) bytes of pseudo random data when generating
   server and client random values. Previously
   (SSL_RANDOM_VALUE - sizeof(time_t)) would be used which would result in
   less random data when sizeof(time_t) &gt; 4 (some 64 bit platforms).

   This change has negligible security impact because:

   1. Server and client random values still have 24 bytes of pseudo random
      data.

   2. Server and client random values are sent in the clear in the initial
      handshake.

   3. The master secret is derived using the premaster secret (48 bytes in
      size for static RSA ciphersuites) as well as client server and random
      values.

   The OpenSSL team would like to thank the UK NISCC for bringing this issue
   to our attention.

   &lt;em&gt;Stephen Henson, reported by UK NISCC&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use Windows randomness collection on Cygwin.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix hang in EGD/PRNGD query when communication socket is closed
   prematurely by EGD/PRNGD.

   *Darren Tucker &lt;dtucker@zip.com.au&gt; via Lutz Jänicke, resolves #1014*

 * Prompt for pass phrases when appropriate for PKCS12 input format.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Back-port of selected performance improvements from development
   branch, as well as improved support for PowerPC platforms.

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add lots of checks for memory allocation failure, error codes to indicate
   failure and freeing up memory if a failure occurs.

   *Nauticus Networks SSL Team &lt;openssl@nauticusnet.com&gt;, Steve Henson*

 * Add new -passin argument to dgst.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Perform some character comparisons of different types in X509_NAME_cmp:
   this is needed for some certificates that re-encode DNs into UTF8Strings
   (in violation of RFC3280) and can't or won't issue name rollover
   certificates.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make an explicit check during certificate validation to see that
   the CA setting in each certificate on the chain is correct.  As a
   side effect always do the following basic checks on extensions,
   not just when there's an associated purpose to the check:

   - if there is an unhandled critical extension (unless the user
     has chosen to ignore this fault)
   - if the path length has been exceeded (if one is set at all)
   - that certain extensions fit the associated purpose (if one has
     been given)

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md143 Changes between 0.9.7d and 0.9.7e  [25 Oct 2004]

 * Avoid a race condition when CRLs are checked in a multi threaded
   environment. This would happen due to the reordering of the revoked
   entries during signature checking and serial number lookup. Now the
   encoding is cached and the serial number sort performed under a lock.
   Add new STACK function sk_is_sorted().

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add Delta CRL to the extension code.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Various fixes to s3_pkt.c so alerts are sent properly.

   *David Holmes &lt;d.holmes@f5.com&gt;*

 * Reduce the chances of duplicate issuer name and serial numbers (in
   violation of RFC3280) using the OpenSSL certificate creation utilities.
   This is done by creating a random 64 bit value for the initial serial
   number when a serial number file is created or when a self signed
   certificate is created using 'openssl req -x509'. The initial serial
   number file is created using 'openssl x509 -next_serial' in CA.pl
   rather than being initialized to 1.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md144 Changes between 0.9.7c and 0.9.7d  [17 Mar 2004]

 * Fix null-pointer assignment in do_change_cipher_spec() revealed
   by using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0079">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0079</a>" &gt;CVE-2004-0079&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Joe Orton, Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix flaw in SSL/TLS handshaking when using Kerberos ciphersuites
   (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0112">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0112</a>" &gt;CVE-2004-0112&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Joe Orton, Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make it possible to have multiple active certificates with the same
   subject in the CA index file.  This is done only if the keyword
   'unique_subject' is set to 'no' in the main CA section (default
   if 'CA_default') of the configuration file.  The value is saved
   with the database itself in a separate index attribute file,
   named like the index file with '.attr' appended to the name.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * X509 verify fixes. Disable broken certificate workarounds when
   X509_V_FLAGS_X509_STRICT is set. Check CRL issuer has cRLSign set if
   keyUsage extension present. Don't accept CRLs with unhandled critical
   extensions: since verify currently doesn't process CRL extensions this
   rejects a CRL with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; critical extensions. Add new verify error codes
   for these cases.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * When creating an OCSP nonce use an OCTET STRING inside the extnValue.
   A clarification of RFC2560 will require the use of OCTET STRINGs and
   some implementations cannot handle the current raw format. Since OpenSSL
   copies and compares OCSP nonces as opaque blobs without any attempt at
   parsing them this should not create any compatibility issues.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New md flag EVP_MD_CTX_FLAG_REUSE this allows md_data to be reused when
   calling EVP_MD_CTX_copy_ex() to avoid calling OPENSSL_malloc(). Without
   this HMAC (and other) operations are several times slower than OpenSSL
   &lt; 0.9.7.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Print out GeneralizedTime and UTCTime in ASN1_STRING_print_ex().

   *Peter Sylvester &lt;Peter.Sylvester@EdelWeb.fr&gt;*

 * Use the correct content when signing type "other".

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md145 Changes between 0.9.7b and 0.9.7c  [30 Sep 2003]

 * Fix various bugs revealed by running the NISCC test suite:

   Stop out of bounds reads in the ASN1 code when presented with
   invalid tags (CVE-2003-0543 and CVE-2003-0544).

   Free up ASN1_TYPE correctly if ANY type is invalid (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0545">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0545</a>" &gt;CVE-2003-0545&lt;/a&gt;).

   If verify callback ignores invalid public key errors don't try to check
   certificate signature with the NULL public key.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New -ignore_err option in ocsp application to stop the server
   exiting on the first error in a request.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In ssl3_accept() (ssl/s3_srvr.c) only accept a client certificate
   if the server requested one: as stated in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0
   specifications.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In ssl3_get_client_hello() (ssl/s3_srvr.c), tolerate additional
   extra data after the compression methods not only for TLS 1.0
   but also for SSL 3.0 (as required by the specification).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Matthias Loepfe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change X509_certificate_type() to mark the key as exported/exportable
   when it's 512 &lt;em&gt;bits&lt;/em&gt; long, not 512 bytes.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change AES_cbc_encrypt() so it outputs exact multiple of
   blocks during encryption.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Various fixes to base64 BIO and non blocking I/O. On write
   flushes were not handled properly if the BIO retried. On read
   data was not being buffered properly and had various logic bugs.
   This also affects blocking I/O when the data being decoded is a
   certain size.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Various S/MIME bugfixes and compatibility changes:
   output correct application/pkcs7 MIME type if
   PKCS7_NOOLDMIMETYPE is set. Tolerate some broken signatures.
   Output CR+LF for EOL if PKCS7_CRLFEOL is set (this makes opening
   of files as .eml work). Correctly handle very long lines in MIME
   parser.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md146 Changes between 0.9.7a and 0.9.7b  [10 Apr 2003]

 * Countermeasure against the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of
   Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding: treat
   a protocol version number mismatch like a decryption error
   in ssl3_get_client_key_exchange (ssl/s3_srvr.c).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Turn on RSA blinding by default in the default implementation
   to avoid a timing attack. Applications that don't want it can call
   RSA_blinding_off() or use the new flag RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING.
   They would be ill-advised to do so in most cases.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie, Steve Henson, Geoff Thorpe, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change RSA blinding code so that it works when the PRNG is not
   seeded (in this case, the secret RSA exponent is abused as
   an unpredictable seed &amp;ndash; if it is not unpredictable, there
   is no point in blinding anyway).  Make RSA blinding thread-safe
   by remembering the creator's thread ID in rsa-&gt;blinding and
   having all other threads use local one-time blinding factors
   (this requires more computation than sharing rsa-&gt;blinding, but
   avoids excessive locking; and if an RSA object is not shared
   between threads, blinding will still be very fast).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fixed a typo bug that would cause ENGINE_set_default() to set an
   ENGINE as defaults for all supported algorithms irrespective of
   the 'flags' parameter. 'flags' is now honoured, so applications
   should make sure they are passing it correctly.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Target "mingw" now allows native Windows code to be generated in
   the Cygwin environment as well as with the MinGW compiler.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md147 Changes between 0.9.7 and 0.9.7a  [19 Feb 2003]

 * In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
   via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrect
   block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
   against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
   between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0078">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0078</a>" &gt;CVE-2003-0078&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Brice Canvel (EPFL),
   Alain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and
   Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL, Ilion)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make the no-err option work as intended.  The intention with no-err
   is not to have the whole error stack handling routines removed from
   libcrypto, it's only intended to remove all the function name and
   reason texts, thereby removing some of the footprint that may not
   be interesting if those errors aren't displayed anyway.

   NOTE: it's still possible for any application or module to have its
   own set of error texts inserted.  The routines are there, just not
   used by default when no-err is given.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for FreeBSD on IA64.

   *dirk.meyer@dinoex.sub.org via Richard Levitte, resolves #454*

 * Adjust DES_cbc_cksum() so it returns the same value as the MIT
   Kerberos function mit_des_cbc_cksum().  Before this change,
   the value returned by DES_cbc_cksum() was like the one from
   mit_des_cbc_cksum(), except the bytes were swapped.

   *Kevin Greaney &lt;Kevin.Greaney@hp.com&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Allow an application to disable the automatic SSL chain building.
   Before this a rather primitive chain build was always performed in
   ssl3_output_cert_chain(): an application had no way to send the
   correct chain if the automatic operation produced an incorrect result.

   Now the chain builder is disabled if either:

   1. Extra certificates are added via SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert().

   2. The mode flag SSL_MODE_NO_AUTO_CHAIN is set.

   The reasoning behind this is that an application would not want the
   auto chain building to take place if extra chain certificates are
   present and it might also want a means of sending no additional
   certificates (for example the chain has two certificates and the
   root is omitted).

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the possibility to build without the ENGINE framework.

   *Steven Reddie &lt;smr@essemer.com.au&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Under Win32 gmtime() can return NULL: check return value in
   OPENSSL_gmtime(). Add error code for case where gmtime() fails.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * DSA routines: under certain error conditions uninitialized BN objects
   could be freed. Solution: make sure initialization is performed early
   enough. (Reported and fix supplied by Ivan D Nestlerode &lt;nestler@MIT.EDU&gt;,
   Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt; via PR#459)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Another fix for SSLv2 session ID handling: the session ID was incorrectly
   checked on reconnect on the client side, therefore session resumption
   could still fail with a "ssl session id is different" error. This
   behaviour is masked when SSL_OP_ALL is used due to
   SSL_OP_MICROSOFT_SESS_ID_BUG being set.
   Behaviour observed by Crispin Flowerday &lt;crispin@flowerday.cx&gt; as
   followup to PR #377.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * IA-32 assembler support enhancements: unified ELF targets, support
   for SCO/Caldera platforms, fix for Cygwin shared build.

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for FreeBSD on sparc64.  As a consequence, support for
   FreeBSD on non-x86 processors is separate from x86 processors on
   the config script, much like the NetBSD support.

   *Richard Levitte &amp; Kris Kennaway &lt;kris@obsecurity.org&gt;*

@subsection autotoc_md148 Changes between 0.9.6h and 0.9.7  [31 Dec 2002]

[NB: OpenSSL 0.9.6i and later 0.9.6 patch levels were released after
OpenSSL 0.9.7.]

 * Fix session ID handling in SSLv2 client code: the SERVER FINISHED
   code (06) was taken as the first octet of the session ID and the last
   octet was ignored consequently. As a result SSLv2 client side session
   caching could not have worked due to the session ID mismatch between
   client and server.
   Behaviour observed by Crispin Flowerday &lt;crispin@flowerday.cx&gt; as
   PR #377.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the declaration of needed Kerberos libraries to use EX_LIBS
   instead of the special (and badly supported) LIBKRB5.  LIBKRB5 is
   removed entirely.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * The hw_ncipher.c engine requires dynamic locks.  Unfortunately, it
   seems that in spite of existing for more than a year, many application
   author have done nothing to provide the necessary callbacks, which
   means that this particular engine will not work properly anywhere.
   This is a very unfortunate situation which forces us, in the name
   of usability, to give the hw_ncipher.c a static lock, which is part
   of libcrypto.
   NOTE: This is for the 0.9.7 series ONLY.  This hack will never
   appear in 0.9.8 or later.  We EXPECT application authors to have
   dealt properly with this when 0.9.8 is released (unless we actually
   make such changes in the libcrypto locking code that changes will
   have to be made anyway).

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * In asn1_d2i_read_bio() repeatedly call BIO_read() until all content
   octets have been read, EOF or an error occurs. Without this change
   some truncated ASN1 structures will not produce an error.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disable Heimdal support, since it hasn't been fully implemented.
   Still give the possibility to force the use of Heimdal, but with
   warnings and a request that patches get sent to openssl-dev.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the VC-CE target, introduce the WINCE sysname, and add
   INSTALL.WCE and appropriate conditionals to make it build.

   *Steven Reddie &lt;smr@essemer.com.au&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Change the DLL names for Cygwin to cygcrypto-x.y.z.dll and
   cygssl-x.y.z.dll, where x, y and z are the major, minor and
   edit numbers of the version.

   *Corinna Vinschen &lt;vinschen@redhat.com&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Introduce safe string copy and catenation functions
   (BUF_strlcpy() and BUF_strlcat()).

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS) and Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid using fixed-size buffers for one-line DNs.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add BUF_MEM_grow_clean() to avoid information leakage when
   resizing buffers containing secrets, and use where appropriate.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid using fixed size buffers for configuration file location.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid filename truncation for various CA files.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use sizeof in preference to magic numbers.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid filename truncation in cert requests.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add assertions to check for (supposedly impossible) buffer
   overflows.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Don't cache truncated DNS entries in the local cache (this could
   potentially lead to a spoofing attack).

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix various buffers to be large enough for hex/decimal
   representations in a platform independent manner.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add CRYPTO_realloc_clean() to avoid information leakage when
   resizing buffers containing secrets, and use where appropriate.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add BIO_indent() to avoid much slightly worrying code to do
   indents.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Convert sprintf()/BIO_puts() to BIO_printf().

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * buffer_gets() could terminate with the buffer only half
   full. Fixed.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add assertions to prevent user-supplied crypto functions from
   overflowing internal buffers by having large block sizes, etc.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * New OPENSSL_assert() macro (similar to assert(), but enabled
   unconditionally).

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Eliminate unused copy of key in RC4.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Eliminate unused and incorrectly sized buffers for IV in pem.h.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix off-by-one error in EGD path.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * If RANDFILE path is too long, ignore instead of truncating.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Eliminate unused and incorrectly sized X.509 structure
   CBCParameter.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Eliminate unused and dangerous function knumber().

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Eliminate unused and dangerous structure, KSSL_ERR.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Protect against overlong session ID context length in an encoded
   session object. Since these are local, this does not appear to be
   exploitable.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change from security patch (see 0.9.6e below) that did not affect
   the 0.9.6 release series:

   Remote buffer overflow in SSL3 protocol - an attacker could
   supply an oversized master key in Kerberos-enabled versions.
   (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0657">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0657</a>" &gt;CVE-2002-0657&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the SSL kerb5 codes to match RFC 2712.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make -nameopt work fully for req and add -reqopt switch.

   *Michael Bell &lt;michael.bell@rz.hu-berlin.de&gt;, Steve Henson*

 * The "block size" for block ciphers in CFB and OFB mode should be 1.

   *Steve Henson, reported by Yngve Nysaeter Pettersen &lt;yngve@opera.com&gt;*

 * Make sure tests can be performed even if the corresponding algorithms
   have been removed entirely.  This was also the last step to make
   OpenSSL compilable with DJGPP under all reasonable conditions.

   *Richard Levitte, Doug Kaufman &lt;dkaufman@rahul.net&gt;*

 * Add cipher selection rules COMPLEMENTOFALL and COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT
   to allow version independent disabling of normally unselected ciphers,
   which may be activated as a side-effect of selecting a single cipher.

   (E.g., cipher list string "RSA" enables ciphersuites that are left
   out of "ALL" because they do not provide symmetric encryption.
   "RSA:!COMPLEMEMENTOFALL" avoids these unsafe ciphersuites.)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add appropriate support for separate platform-dependent build
   directories.  The recommended way to make a platform-dependent
   build directory is the following (tested on Linux), maybe with
   some local tweaks:
@iverbatim 
    # Place yourself outside of the OpenSSL source tree.  In
    # this example, the environment variable OPENSSL_SOURCE
    # is assumed to contain the absolute OpenSSL source directory.
    mkdir -p objtree/"`uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -m`"
    cd objtree/"`uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -m`"
    (cd $OPENSSL_SOURCE; find . -type f) | while read F; do
            mkdir -p `dirname $F`
            ln -s $OPENSSL_SOURCE/$F $F
    done
@endiverbatim
   To be absolutely sure not to disturb the source tree, a "make clean"
   is a good thing.  If it isn't successful, don't worry about it,
   it probably means the source directory is very clean.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make sure any ENGINE control commands make local copies of string
   pointers passed to them whenever necessary. Otherwise it is possible
   the caller may have overwritten (or deallocated) the original string
   data when a later ENGINE operation tries to use the stored values.

   *Götz Babin-Ebell &lt;babinebell@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Improve diagnostics in file reading and command-line digests.

   *Ben Laurie aided and abetted by Solar Designer &lt;solar@openwall.com&gt;*

 * Add AES modes CFB and OFB to the object database.  Correct an
   error in AES-CFB decryption.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Remove most calls to EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup() in evp_enc.c, this
   allows existing EVP_CIPHER_CTX structures to be reused after
   calling &lt;tt&gt;EVP_*Final()&lt;/tt&gt;. This behaviour is used by encryption
   BIOs and some applications. This has the side effect that
   applications must explicitly clean up cipher contexts with
   EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup() or they will leak memory.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Check the values of dna and dnb in bn_mul_recursive before calling
   bn_mul_comba (a non zero value means the a or b arrays do not contain
   n2 elements) and fallback to bn_mul_normal if either is not zero.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix escaping of non-ASCII characters when using the -subj option
   of the "openssl req" command line tool. (Robert Joop &lt;joop@fokus.gmd.de&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make object definitions compliant to LDAP (RFC2256): SN is the short
   form for "surname", serialNumber has no short form.
   Use "mail" as the short name for "rfc822Mailbox" according to RFC2798;
   therefore remove "mail" short name for "internet 7".
   The OID for unique identifiers in X509 certificates is
   x500UniqueIdentifier, not uniqueIdentifier.
   Some more OID additions. (Michael Bell &lt;michael.bell@rz.hu-berlin.de&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add an "init" command to the ENGINE config module and auto initialize
   ENGINEs. Without any "init" command the ENGINE will be initialized
   after all ctrl commands have been executed on it. If init=1 the
   ENGINE is initialized at that point (ctrls before that point are run
   on the uninitialized ENGINE and after on the initialized one). If
   init=0 then the ENGINE will not be initialized at all.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix the 'app_verify_callback' interface so that the user-defined
   argument is actually passed to the callback: In the
   SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() prototype, the callback
   declaration has been changed from
           int (*cb)()
   into
           int (*cb)(X509_STORE_CTX *,void *);
   in ssl_verify_cert_chain (ssl/ssl_cert.c), the call
           i=s-&gt;ctx-&gt;app_verify_callback(&amp;ctx)
   has been changed into
           i=s-&gt;ctx-&gt;app_verify_callback(&amp;ctx, s-&gt;ctx-&gt;app_verify_arg).

   To update applications using SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(),
   a dummy argument can be added to their callback functions.

   *D. K. Smetters &lt;smetters@parc.xerox.com&gt;*

 * Added the '4758cca' ENGINE to support IBM 4758 cards.

   *Maurice Gittens &lt;maurice@gittens.nl&gt;, touchups by Geoff Thorpe*

 * Add and OPENSSL_LOAD_CONF define which will cause
   OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() to load the openssl.cnf config file.
   This allows older applications to transparently support certain
   OpenSSL features: such as crypto acceleration and dynamic ENGINE loading.
   Two new functions OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms_noconf() which will never
   load the config file and OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms_conf() which will
   always load it have also been added.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the OFB, CFB and CTR (all with 128 bit feedback) to AES.
   Adjust NIDs and EVP layer.

   *Stephen Sprunk &lt;stephen@sprunk.org&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Config modules support in openssl utility.

   Most commands now load modules from the config file,
   though in a few (such as version) this isn't done
   because it couldn't be used for anything.

   In the case of ca and req the config file used is
   the same as the utility itself: that is the -config
   command line option can be used to specify an
   alternative file.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Move default behaviour from OPENSSL_config(). If appname is NULL
   use "openssl_conf" if filename is NULL use default openssl config file.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add an argument to OPENSSL_config() to allow the use of an alternative
   config section name. Add a new flag to tolerate a missing config file
   and move code to CONF_modules_load_file().

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Support for crypto accelerator cards from Accelerated Encryption
   Processing, www.aep.ie.  (Use engine 'aep')
   The support was copied from 0.9.6c [engine] and adapted/corrected
   to work with the new engine framework.

   &lt;em&gt;AEP Inc. and Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Support for SureWare crypto accelerator cards from Baltimore
   Technologies.  (Use engine 'sureware')
   The support was copied from 0.9.6c [engine] and adapted
   to work with the new engine framework.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Have the CHIL engine fork-safe (as defined by nCipher) and actually
   make the newer ENGINE framework commands for the CHIL engine work.

   *Toomas Kiisk &lt;vix@cyber.ee&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Make it possible to produce shared libraries on ReliantUNIX.

   *Robert Dahlem &lt;Robert.Dahlem@ffm2.siemens.de&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Add the configuration target debug-linux-ppro.
   Make 'openssl rsa' use the general key loading routines
   implemented in &lt;tt&gt;apps.c&lt;/tt&gt;, and make those routines able to
   handle the key format FORMAT_NETSCAPE and the variant
   FORMAT_IISSGC.

   *Toomas Kiisk &lt;vix@cyber.ee&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Fix a crashbug and a logic bug in hwcrhk_load_pubkey().

   *Toomas Kiisk &lt;vix@cyber.ee&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Add -keyform to rsautl, and document -engine.

   *Richard Levitte, inspired by Toomas Kiisk &lt;vix@cyber.ee&gt;*

 * Change BIO_new_file (crypto/bio/bss_file.c) to use new
   BIO_R_NO_SUCH_FILE error code rather than the generic
   ERR_R_SYS_LIB error code if fopen() fails with ENOENT.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add new functions
           ERR_peek_last_error
           ERR_peek_last_error_line
           ERR_peek_last_error_line_data.
   These are similar to
           ERR_peek_error
           ERR_peek_error_line
           ERR_peek_error_line_data,
   but report on the latest error recorded rather than the first one
   still in the error queue.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * default_algorithms option in ENGINE config module. This allows things
   like:
   default_algorithms = ALL
   default_algorithms = RSA, DSA, RAND, CIPHERS, DIGESTS

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Preliminary ENGINE config module.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New experimental application configuration code.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the AES code to follow the same name structure as all other
   symmetric ciphers, and behave the same way.  Move everything to
   the directory crypto/aes, thereby obsoleting crypto/rijndael.

   *Stephen Sprunk &lt;stephen@sprunk.org&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * SECURITY: remove unsafe setjmp/signal interaction from ui_openssl.c.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie and Theo de Raadt&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add option to output public keys in req command.

   *Massimiliano Pala madwolf@openca.org*

 * Use wNAFs in EC_POINTs_mul() for improved efficiency
   (up to about 10% better than before for P-192 and P-224).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New functions/macros
@iverbatim 
    SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback(ctx, cb)
    SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback_arg(ctx, arg)
    SSL_set_msg_callback(ssl, cb)
    SSL_set_msg_callback_arg(ssl, arg)
@endiverbatim
   to request calling a callback function
@iverbatim 
    void cb(int write_p, int version, int content_type,
            const void *buf, size_t len, SSL *ssl, void *arg)
@endiverbatim
   whenever a protocol message has been completely received
   (write_p == 0) or sent (write_p == 1).  Here 'version' is the
   protocol version  according to which the SSL library interprets
   the current protocol message (SSL2_VERSION, SSL3_VERSION, or
   TLS1_VERSION).  'content_type' is 0 in the case of SSL 2.0, or
   the content type as defined in the SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 protocol
   specification (change_cipher_spec(20), alert(21), handshake(22)).
   'buf' and 'len' point to the actual message, 'ssl' to the
   SSL object, and 'arg' is the application-defined value set by
   SSL[_CTX]_set_msg_callback_arg().

   'openssl s_client' and 'openssl s_server' have new '-msg' options
   to enable a callback that displays all protocol messages.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the shared library support so shared libraries are built as
   soon as the corresponding static library is finished, and thereby get
   openssl and the test programs linked against the shared library.
   This still only happens when the keyword "shard" has been given to
   the configuration scripts.

   NOTE: shared library support is still an experimental thing, and
   backward binary compatibility is still not guaranteed.

   *"Maciej W. Rozycki" &lt;macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Add support for Subject Information Access extension.

   *Peter Sylvester &lt;Peter.Sylvester@EdelWeb.fr&gt;*

 * Make BUF_MEM_grow() behaviour more consistent: Initialise to zero
   additional bytes when new memory had to be allocated, not just
   when reusing an existing buffer.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New command line and configuration option 'utf8' for the req command.
   This allows field values to be specified as UTF8 strings.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add -multi and -mr options to "openssl speed" - giving multiple parallel
   runs for the former and machine-readable output for the latter.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add '-noemailDN' option to 'openssl ca'.  This prevents inclusion
   of the e-mail address in the DN (i.e., it will go into a certificate
   extension only).  The new configuration file option 'email_in_dn = no'
   has the same effect.

   *Massimiliano Pala madwolf@openca.org*

 * Change all functions with names starting with &lt;tt&gt;des_&lt;/tt&gt; to be starting
   with &lt;tt&gt;DES_&lt;/tt&gt; instead.  Add wrappers that are compatible with libdes,
   but are named &lt;tt&gt;_ossl_old_des_*&lt;/tt&gt;.  Finally, add macros that map the
   &lt;tt&gt;des_*&lt;/tt&gt; symbols to the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;_ossl_old_des_*&lt;/tt&gt; if libdes
   compatibility is desired.  If OpenSSL 0.9.6c compatibility is
   desired, the &lt;tt&gt;des_*&lt;/tt&gt; symbols will be mapped to &lt;tt&gt;DES_*&lt;/tt&gt;, with one
   exception.

   Since we provide two compatibility mappings, the user needs to
   define the macro OPENSSL_DES_LIBDES_COMPATIBILITY if libdes
   compatibility is desired.  The default (i.e., when that macro
   isn't defined) is OpenSSL 0.9.6c compatibility.

   There are also macros that enable and disable the support of old
   des functions altogether.  Those are OPENSSL_ENABLE_OLD_DES_SUPPORT
   and OPENSSL_DISABLE_OLD_DES_SUPPORT.  If none or both of those
   are defined, the default will apply: to support the old des routines.

   In either case, one must include openssl/des.h to get the correct
   definitions.  Do not try to just include openssl/des_old.h, that
   won't work.

   NOTE: This is a major break of an old API into a new one.  Software
   authors are encouraged to switch to the &lt;tt&gt;DES_&lt;/tt&gt; style functions.  Some
   time in the future, des_old.h and the libdes compatibility functions
   will be disable (i.e. OPENSSL_DISABLE_OLD_DES_SUPPORT will be the
   default), and then completely removed.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Test for certificates which contain unsupported critical extensions.
   If such a certificate is found during a verify operation it is
   rejected by default: this behaviour can be overridden by either
   handling the new error X509_V_ERR_UNHANDLED_CRITICAL_EXTENSION or
   by setting the verify flag X509_V_FLAG_IGNORE_CRITICAL. A new function
   X509_supported_extension() has also been added which returns 1 if a
   particular extension is supported.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Modify the behaviour of EVP cipher functions in similar way to digests
   to retain compatibility with existing code.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Modify the behaviour of EVP_DigestInit() and EVP_DigestFinal() to retain
   compatibility with existing code. In particular the 'ctx' parameter does
   not have to be to be initialized before the call to EVP_DigestInit() and
   it is tidied up after a call to EVP_DigestFinal(). New function
   EVP_DigestFinal_ex() which does not tidy up the ctx. Similarly function
   EVP_MD_CTX_copy() changed to not require the destination to be
   initialized valid and new function EVP_MD_CTX_copy_ex() added which
   requires the destination to be valid.

   Modify all the OpenSSL digest calls to use EVP_DigestInit_ex(),
   EVP_DigestFinal_ex() and EVP_MD_CTX_copy_ex().

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change ssl3_get_message (ssl/s3_both.c) and the functions using it
   so that complete 'Handshake' protocol structures are kept in memory
   instead of overwriting 'msg_type' and 'length' with 'body' data.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add an implementation of SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack for Win32.

   &lt;em&gt;Massimo Santin via Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Major restructuring to the underlying ENGINE code. This includes
   reduction of linker bloat, separation of pure "ENGINE" manipulation
   (initialisation, etc) from functionality dealing with implementations
   of specific crypto interfaces. This change also introduces integrated
   support for symmetric ciphers and digest implementations - so ENGINEs
   can now accelerate these by providing EVP_CIPHER and EVP_MD
   implementations of their own. This is detailed in
   @ref "C:/Users/namph/Downloads/openssl/openssl-3.2.1/crypto/engine/README.md" "crypto/engine/README.md"
   as it couldn't be adequately described here. However, there are a few
   API changes worth noting - some RSA, DSA, DH, and RAND functions that
   were changed in the original introduction of ENGINE code have now
   reverted back - the hooking from this code to ENGINE is now a good
   deal more passive and at run-time, operations deal directly with
   RSA_METHODs, DSA_METHODs (etc) as they did before, rather than
   dereferencing through an ENGINE pointer any more. Also, the ENGINE
   functions dealing with &lt;tt&gt;BN_MOD_EXP[_CRT]&lt;/tt&gt; handlers have been removed -
   they were not being used by the framework as there is no concept of a
   BIGNUM_METHOD and they could not be generalised to the new
   'ENGINE_TABLE' mechanism that underlies the new code. Similarly,
   ENGINE_cpy() has been removed as it cannot be consistently defined in
   the new code.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME_check() to allow fractional seconds.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change mkdef.pl to sort symbols that get the same entry number,
   and make sure the automatically generated functions &lt;tt&gt;ERR_load_*&lt;/tt&gt;
   become part of libeay.num as well.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function SSL_renegotiate_pending().  This returns true once
   renegotiation has been requested (either SSL_renegotiate() call
   or HelloRequest/ClientHello received from the peer) and becomes
   false once a handshake has been completed.
   (For servers, SSL_renegotiate() followed by SSL_do_handshake()
   sends a HelloRequest, but does not ensure that a handshake takes
   place.  SSL_renegotiate_pending() is useful for checking if the
   client has followed the request.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New SSL option SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION.
   By default, clients may request session resumption even during
   renegotiation (if session ID contexts permit); with this option,
   session resumption is possible only in the first handshake.

   SSL_OP_ALL is now 0x00000FFFL instead of 0x000FFFFFL.  This makes
   more bits available for options that should not be part of
   SSL_OP_ALL (such as SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add some demos for certificate and certificate request creation.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make maximum certificate chain size accepted from the peer application
   settable (&lt;tt&gt;SSL*_get/set_max_cert_list()&lt;/tt&gt;), as proposed by
   "Douglas E. Engert" &lt;deengert@anl.gov&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for shared libraries for Unixware-7
   (Boyd Lynn Gerber &lt;gerberb@zenez.com&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a "destroy" handler to ENGINEs that allows structural cleanup to
   be done prior to destruction. Use this to unload error strings from
   ENGINEs that load their own error strings. NB: This adds two new API
   functions to "get" and "set" this destroy handler in an ENGINE.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Alter all existing ENGINE implementations (except "openssl" and
   "openbsd") to dynamically instantiate their own error strings. This
   makes them more flexible to be built both as statically-linked ENGINEs
   and self-contained shared-libraries loadable via the "dynamic" ENGINE.
   Also, add stub code to each that makes building them as self-contained
   shared-libraries easier (see @ref "README-Engine.md" "README-Engine.md").

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a "dynamic" ENGINE that provides a mechanism for binding ENGINE
   implementations into applications that are completely implemented in
   self-contained shared-libraries. The "dynamic" ENGINE exposes control
   commands that can be used to configure what shared-library to load and
   to control aspects of the way it is handled. Also, made an update to
   the @ref "README-Engine.md" "README-Engine.md" file
   that brings its information up-to-date and
   provides some information and instructions on the "dynamic" ENGINE
   (ie. how to use it, how to build "dynamic"-loadable ENGINEs, etc).

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make it possible to unload ranges of ERR strings with a new
   "ERR_unload_strings" function.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a copy() function to EVP_MD.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make EVP_MD routines take a context pointer instead of just the
   md_data void pointer.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add flags to EVP_MD and EVP_MD_CTX. EVP_MD_FLAG_ONESHOT indicates
   that the digest can only process a single chunk of data
   (typically because it is provided by a piece of
   hardware). EVP_MD_CTX_FLAG_ONESHOT indicates that the application
   is only going to provide a single chunk of data, and hence the
   framework needn't accumulate the data for oneshot drivers.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * As with "ERR", make it possible to replace the underlying "ex_data"
   functions. This change also alters the storage and management of global
   ex_data state - it's now all inside ex_data.c and all "class" code (eg.
   RSA, BIO, SSL_CTX, etc) no longer stores its own STACKS and per-class
   index counters. The API functions that use this state have been changed
   to take a "class_index" rather than pointers to the class's local STACK
   and counter, and there is now an API function to dynamically create new
   classes. This centralisation allows us to (a) plug a lot of the
   thread-safety problems that existed, and (b) makes it possible to clean
   up all allocated state using "CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data()". W.r.t. (b)
   such data would previously have always leaked in application code and
   workarounds were in place to make the memory debugging turn a blind eye
   to it. Application code that doesn't use this new function will still
   leak as before, but their memory debugging output will announce it now
   rather than letting it slide.

   Besides the addition of CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data(), another API change
   induced by the "ex_data" overhaul is that X509_STORE_CTX_init() now
   has a return value to indicate success or failure.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make it possible to replace the underlying "ERR" functions such that the
   global state (2 LHASH tables and 2 locks) is only used by the "default"
   implementation. This change also adds two functions to "get" and "set"
   the implementation prior to it being automatically set the first time
   any other ERR function takes place. Ie. an application can call "get",
   pass the return value to a module it has just loaded, and that module
   can call its own "set" function using that value. This means the
   module's "ERR" operations will use (and modify) the error state in the
   application and not in its own statically linked copy of OpenSSL code.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Give DH, DSA, and RSA types their own &lt;tt&gt;*_up_ref()&lt;/tt&gt; function to increment
   reference counts. This performs normal REF_PRINT/REF_CHECK macros on
   the operation, and provides a more encapsulated way for external code
   (crypto/evp/ and ssl/) to do this. Also changed the evp and ssl code
   to use these functions rather than manually incrementing the counts.

   Also rename "DSO_up()" function to more descriptive "DSO_up_ref()".

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add EVP test program.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add symmetric cipher support to ENGINE. Expect the API to change!

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * New CRL functions: X509_CRL_set_version(), X509_CRL_set_issuer_name()
   X509_CRL_set_lastUpdate(), X509_CRL_set_nextUpdate(), X509_CRL_sort(),
   X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber(), and X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate().
   These allow a CRL to be built without having to access X509_CRL fields
   directly. Modify 'ca' application to use new functions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Move SSL_OP_TLS_ROLLBACK_BUG out of the SSL_OP_ALL list of recommended
   bug workarounds. Rollback attack detection is a security feature.
   The problem will only arise on OpenSSL servers when TLSv1 is not
   available (sslv3_server_method() or SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1).
   Software authors not wanting to support TLSv1 will have special reasons
   for their choice and can explicitly enable this option.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller, Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rationalise EVP so it can be extended: don't include a union of
   cipher/digest structures, add init/cleanup functions for EVP_MD_CTX
   (similar to those existing for EVP_CIPHER_CTX).
   Usage example:
@iverbatim 
    EVP_MD_CTX md;

    EVP_MD_CTX_init(&amp;md);             /* new function call */
    EVP_DigestInit(&amp;md, EVP_sha1());
    EVP_DigestUpdate(&amp;md, in, len);
    EVP_DigestFinal(&amp;md, out, NULL);
    EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup(&amp;md);          /* new function call */
@endiverbatim
   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make DES key schedule conform to the usual scheme, as well as
   correcting its structure. This means that calls to DES functions
   now have to pass a pointer to a des_key_schedule instead of a
   plain des_key_schedule (which was actually always a pointer
   anyway): E.g.,
@iverbatim 
    des_key_schedule ks;

    des_set_key_checked(..., &amp;ks);
    des_ncbc_encrypt(..., &amp;ks, ...);
@endiverbatim
   (Note that a later change renames 'des_...' into 'DES_...'.)

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initial reduction of linker bloat: the use of some functions, such as
   PEM causes large amounts of unused functions to be linked in due to
   poor organisation. For example pem_all.c contains every PEM function
   which has a knock on effect of linking in large amounts of (unused)
   ASN1 code. Grouping together similar functions and splitting unrelated
   functions prevents this.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Cleanup of EVP macros.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change historical references to &lt;tt&gt;{NID,SN,LN}_des_ede&lt;/tt&gt; and ede3 to add the
   correct &lt;tt&gt;_ecb suffix&lt;/tt&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add initial OCSP responder support to ocsp application. The
   revocation information is handled using the text based index
   use by the ca application. The responder can either handle
   requests generated internally, supplied in files (for example
   via a CGI script) or using an internal minimal server.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add configuration choices to get zlib compression for TLS.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Changes to Kerberos SSL for RFC 2712 compliance:
   1. Implemented real KerberosWrapper, instead of just using
      KRB5 AP_REQ message.  [Thanks to Simon Wilkinson &lt;sxw@sxw.org.uk&gt;]
   2. Implemented optional authenticator field of KerberosWrapper.

   Added openssl-style ASN.1 macros for Kerberos ticket, ap_req,
   and authenticator structs; see crypto/krb5/.

   Generalized Kerberos calls to support multiple Kerberos libraries.
   *Vern Staats &lt;staatsvr@asc.hpc.mil&gt;, Jeffrey Altman &lt;jaltman@columbia.edu&gt;
   via Richard Levitte*

 * Cause 'openssl speed' to use fully hard-coded DSA keys as it
   already does with RSA. testdsa.h now has 'priv_key/pub_key'
   values for each of the key sizes rather than having just
   parameters (and 'speed' generating keys each time).

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Speed up EVP routines.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added the OS2-EMX target.

   *"Brian Havard" &lt;brianh@kheldar.apana.org.au&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Rewrite commands to use &lt;tt&gt;NCONF&lt;/tt&gt; routines instead of the old &lt;tt&gt;CONF&lt;/tt&gt;.
   New functions to support &lt;tt&gt;NCONF&lt;/tt&gt; routines in extension code.
   New function &lt;tt&gt;CONF_set_nconf()&lt;/tt&gt;
   to allow functions which take an &lt;tt&gt;NCONF&lt;/tt&gt; to also handle the old &lt;tt&gt;LHASH&lt;/tt&gt;
   structure: this means that the old &lt;tt&gt;CONF&lt;/tt&gt; compatible routines can be
   retained (in particular w.rt. extensions) without having to duplicate the
   code. New function &lt;tt&gt;X509V3_add_ext_nconf_sk()&lt;/tt&gt; to add extensions to a stack.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Enhance the general user interface with mechanisms for inner control
   and with possibilities to have yes/no kind of prompts.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change all calls to low-level digest routines in the library and
   applications to use EVP. Add missing calls to HMAC_cleanup() and
   don't assume HMAC_CTX can be copied using memcpy().

   *Verdon Walker &lt;VWalker@novell.com&gt;, Steve Henson*

 * Add the possibility to control engines through control names but with
   arbitrary arguments instead of just a string.
   Change the key loaders to take a UI_METHOD instead of a callback
   function pointer.  NOTE: this breaks binary compatibility with earlier
   versions of OpenSSL [engine].
   Adapt the nCipher code for these new conditions and add a card insertion
   callback.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Enhance the general user interface with mechanisms to better support
   dialog box interfaces, application-defined prompts, the possibility
   to use defaults (for example default passwords from somewhere else)
   and interrupts/cancellations.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Tidy up PKCS#12 attribute handling. Add support for the CSP name
   attribute in PKCS#12 files, add new -CSP option to pkcs12 utility.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix a memory leak in 'sk_dup()' in the case reallocation fails. (Also
   tidy up some unnecessarily weird code in 'sk_new()').

   *Geoff, reported by Diego Tartara &lt;dtartara@novamens.com&gt;*

 * Change the key loading routines for ENGINEs to use the same kind
   callback (pem_password_cb) as all other routines that need this
   kind of callback.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Increase ENTROPY_NEEDED to 32 bytes, as Rijndael can operate with
   256 bit (=32 byte) keys. Of course seeding with more entropy bytes
   than this minimum value is recommended.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * New random seeder for OpenVMS, using the system process statistics
   that are easily reachable.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Windows apparently can't transparently handle global
   variables defined in DLLs. Initialisations such as:
@iverbatim 
    const ASN1_ITEM *it = &amp;ASN1_INTEGER_it;
@endiverbatim
   won't compile. This is used by the any applications that need to
   declare their own ASN1 modules. This was fixed by adding the option
   EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN to all Win32 platforms, although this isn't strictly
   needed for static libraries under Win32.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New functions X509_PURPOSE_set() and X509_TRUST_set() to handle
   setting of purpose and trust fields. New X509_STORE trust and
   purpose functions and tidy up setting in other SSL functions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add copies of X509_STORE_CTX fields and callbacks to X509_STORE
   structure. These are inherited by X509_STORE_CTX when it is
   initialised. This allows various defaults to be set in the
   X509_STORE structure (such as flags for CRL checking and custom
   purpose or trust settings) for functions which only use X509_STORE_CTX
   internally such as S/MIME.

   Modify X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit() so it only sets purposes and
   trust settings if they are not set in X509_STORE. This allows X509_STORE
   purposes and trust (in S/MIME for example) to override any set by default.

   Add command line options for CRL checking to smime, s_client and s_server
   applications.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initial CRL based revocation checking. If the CRL checking flag(s)
   are set then the CRL is looked up in the X509_STORE structure and
   its validity and signature checked, then if the certificate is found
   in the CRL the verify fails with a revoked error.

   Various new CRL related callbacks added to X509_STORE_CTX structure.

   Command line options added to 'verify' application to support this.

   This needs some additional work, such as being able to handle multiple
   CRLs with different times, extension based lookup (rather than just
   by subject name) and ultimately more complete V2 CRL extension
   handling.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a general user interface API (crypto/ui/).  This is designed
   to replace things like des_read_password and friends (backward
   compatibility functions using this new API are provided).
   The purpose is to remove prompting functions from the DES code
   section as well as provide for prompting through dialog boxes in
   a window system and the like.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add "ex_data" support to ENGINE so implementations can add state at a
   per-structure level rather than having to store it globally.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make it possible for ENGINE structures to be copied when retrieved by
   ENGINE_by_id() if the ENGINE specifies a new flag: ENGINE_FLAGS_BY_ID_COPY.
   This causes the "original" ENGINE structure to act like a template,
   analogous to the RSA vs. RSA_METHOD type of separation. Because of this
   operational state can be localised to each ENGINE structure, despite the
   fact they all share the same "methods". New ENGINE structures returned in
   this case have no functional references and the return value is the single
   structural reference. This matches the single structural reference returned
   by ENGINE_by_id() normally, when it is incremented on the pre-existing
   ENGINE structure.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix ASN1 decoder when decoding type ANY and V_ASN1_OTHER: since this
   needs to match any other type at all we need to manually clear the
   tag cache.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Changes to the "openssl engine" utility to include;
   - verbosity levels ('-v', '-vv', and '-vvv') that provide information
     about an ENGINE's available control commands.
   - executing control commands from command line arguments using the
     '-pre' and '-post' switches. '-post' is only used if '-t' is
     specified and the ENGINE is successfully initialised. The syntax for
     the individual commands are colon-separated, for example;
           openssl engine chil -pre FORK_CHECK:0 -pre SO_PATH:/lib/test.so

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * New dynamic control command support for ENGINEs. ENGINEs can now
   declare their own commands (numbers), names (strings), descriptions,
   and input types for run-time discovery by calling applications. A
   subset of these commands are implicitly classed as "executable"
   depending on their input type, and only these can be invoked through
   the new string-based API function ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(). (Eg. this
   can be based on user input, config files, etc). The distinction is
   that "executable" commands cannot return anything other than a boolean
   result and can only support numeric or string input, whereas some
   discoverable commands may only be for direct use through
   ENGINE_ctrl(), eg. supporting the exchange of binary data, function
   pointers, or other custom uses. The "executable" commands are to
   support parameterisations of ENGINE behaviour that can be
   unambiguously defined by ENGINEs and used consistently across any
   OpenSSL-based application. Commands have been added to all the
   existing hardware-supporting ENGINEs, noticeably "SO_PATH" to allow
   control over shared-library paths without source code alterations.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Changed all ENGINE implementations to dynamically allocate their
   ENGINEs rather than declaring them statically. Apart from this being
   necessary with the removal of the ENGINE_FLAGS_MALLOCED distinction,
   this also allows the implementations to compile without using the
   internal engine_int.h header.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Minor adjustment to "rand" code. RAND_get_rand_method() now returns a
   'const' value. Any code that should be able to modify a RAND_METHOD
   should already have non-const pointers to it (ie. they should only
   modify their own ones).

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Made a variety of little tweaks to the ENGINE code.
   - "atalla" and "ubsec" string definitions were moved from header files
     to C code. "nuron" string definitions were placed in variables
     rather than hard-coded - allowing parameterisation of these values
     later on via ctrl() commands.
   - Removed unused "if 0"'d code.
   - Fixed engine list iteration code so it uses ENGINE_free() to release
     structural references.
   - Constified the RAND_METHOD element of ENGINE structures.
   - Constified various get/set functions as appropriate and added
     missing functions (including a catch-all ENGINE_cpy that duplicates
     all ENGINE values onto a new ENGINE except reference counts/state).
   - Removed NULL parameter checks in get/set functions. Setting a method
     or function to NULL is a way of cancelling out a previously set
     value.  Passing a NULL ENGINE parameter is just plain stupid anyway
     and doesn't justify the extra error symbols and code.
   - Deprecate the ENGINE_FLAGS_MALLOCED define and move the area for
     flags from engine_int.h to engine.h.
   - Changed prototypes for ENGINE handler functions (init(), finish(),
     ctrl(), key-load functions, etc) to take an (ENGINE*) parameter.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff&lt;/em&gt;

 * Implement binary inversion algorithm for BN_mod_inverse in addition
   to the algorithm using long division.  The binary algorithm can be
   used only if the modulus is odd.  On 32-bit systems, it is faster
   only for relatively small moduli (roughly 20-30% for 128-bit moduli,
   roughly 5-15% for 256-bit moduli), so we use it only for moduli
   up to 450 bits.  In 64-bit environments, the binary algorithm
   appears to be advantageous for much longer moduli; here we use it
   for moduli up to 2048 bits.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rewrite CHOICE field setting in ASN1_item_ex_d2i(). The old code
   could not support the combine flag in choice fields.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a 'copy_extensions' option to the 'ca' utility. This copies
   extensions from a certificate request to the certificate.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Allow multiple 'certopt' and 'nameopt' options to be separated
   by commas. Add 'namopt' and 'certopt' options to the 'ca' config
   file: this allows the display of the certificate about to be
   signed to be customised, to allow certain fields to be included
   or excluded and extension details. The old system didn't display
   multicharacter strings properly, omitted fields not in the policy
   and couldn't display additional details such as extensions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Function EC_POINTs_mul for multiple scalar multiplication
   of an arbitrary number of elliptic curve points
           \sum scalars[i]*points[i],
   optionally including the generator defined for the EC_GROUP:
           scalar*generator +  \sum scalars[i]*points[i].

   EC_POINT_mul is a simple wrapper function for the typical case
   that the point list has just one item (besides the optional
   generator).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * First EC_METHODs for curves over GF(p):

   EC_GFp_simple_method() uses the basic BN_mod_mul and BN_mod_sqr
   operations and provides various method functions that can also
   operate with faster implementations of modular arithmetic.

   EC_GFp_mont_method() reuses most functions that are part of
   EC_GFp_simple_method, but uses Montgomery arithmetic.

   *Bodo Moeller; point addition and point doubling
   implementation directly derived from source code provided by
   Lenka Fibikova &lt;fibikova@exp-math.uni-essen.de&gt;*

 * Framework for elliptic curves (crypto/ec/ec.h, crypto/ec/ec_lcl.h,
   crypto/ec/ec_lib.c):

   Curves are EC_GROUP objects (with an optional group generator)
   based on EC_METHODs that are built into the library.

   Points are EC_POINT objects based on EC_GROUP objects.

   Most of the framework would be able to handle curves over arbitrary
   finite fields, but as there are no obvious types for fields other
   than GF(p), some functions are limited to that for now.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the -HTTP option to s_server.  It is similar to -WWW, but requires
   that the file contains a complete HTTP response.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the ec directory to mkdef.pl and mkfiles.pl. In mkdef.pl
   change the def and num file printf format specifier from "%-40sXXX"
   to "%-39s XXX". The latter will always guarantee a space after the
   field while the former will cause them to run together if the field
   is 40 of more characters long.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Constify the cipher and digest 'method' functions and structures
   and modify related functions to take constant EVP_MD and EVP_CIPHER
   pointers.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Hide BN_CTX structure details in bn_lcl.h instead of publishing them
   in &lt;openssl/bn.h&gt;.  Also further increase BN_CTX_NUM to 32.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Modify &lt;tt&gt;EVP_Digest*()&lt;/tt&gt; routines so they now return values. Although the
   internal software routines can never fail additional hardware versions
   might.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Clean up crypto/err/err.h and change some error codes to avoid conflicts:

   Previously ERR_R_FATAL was too small and coincided with ERR_LIB_PKCS7
   (= ERR_R_PKCS7_LIB); it is now 64 instead of 32.

   ASN1 error codes
           ERR_R_NESTED_ASN1_ERROR
           ...
           ERR_R_MISSING_ASN1_EOS
   were 4 .. 9, conflicting with
           ERR_LIB_RSA (= ERR_R_RSA_LIB)
           ...
           ERR_LIB_PEM (= ERR_R_PEM_LIB).
   They are now 58 .. 63 (i.e., just below ERR_R_FATAL).

   Add new error code 'ERR_R_INTERNAL_ERROR'.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Don't overuse locks in crypto/err/err.c: For data retrieval, CRYPTO_r_lock
   suffices.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New option '-subj arg' for 'openssl req' and 'openssl ca'.  This
   sets the subject name for a new request or supersedes the
   subject name in a given request. Formats that can be parsed are
           'CN=Some Name, OU=myOU, C=IT'
   and
           'CN=Some Name/OU=myOU/C=IT'.

   Add options '-batch' and '-verbose' to 'openssl req'.

   *Massimiliano Pala &lt;madwolf@hackmasters.net&gt;*

 * Introduce the possibility to access global variables through
   functions on platform were that's the best way to handle exporting
   global variables in shared libraries.  To enable this functionality,
   one must configure with "EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN" or defined the C macro
   "OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION" in crypto/opensslconf.h (the latter
   is normally done by Configure or something similar).

   To implement a global variable, use the macro OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL
   in the source file (foo.c) like this:
@iverbatim 
    OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL(int,foo)=1;
    OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL(double,bar);
@endiverbatim
   To declare a global variable, use the macros OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL
   and OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF in the header file (foo.h) like this:
@iverbatim 
    OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL(int,foo);
    #define foo OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF(foo)
    OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL(double,bar);
    #define bar OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF(bar)
@endiverbatim
   The #defines are very important, and therefore so is including the
   header file everywhere where the defined globals are used.

   The macro OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION also affects the definition
   of ASN.1 items, but that structure is a bit different.

   The largest change is in util/mkdef.pl which has been enhanced with
   better and easier to understand logic to choose which symbols should
   go into the Windows .def files as well as a number of fixes and code
   cleanup (among others, algorithm keywords are now sorted
   lexicographically to avoid constant rewrites).

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * In BN_div() keep a copy of the sign of 'num' before writing the
   result to 'rm' because if rm==num the value will be overwritten
   and produce the wrong result if 'num' is negative: this caused
   problems with BN_mod() and BN_nnmod().

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Function OCSP_request_verify(). This checks the signature on an
   OCSP request and verifies the signer certificate. The signer
   certificate is just checked for a generic purpose and OCSP request
   trust settings.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add OCSP_check_validity() function to check the validity of OCSP
   responses. OCSP responses are prepared in real time and may only
   be a few seconds old. Simply checking that the current time lies
   between thisUpdate and nextUpdate max reject otherwise valid responses
   caused by either OCSP responder or client clock inaccuracy. Instead
   we allow thisUpdate and nextUpdate to fall within a certain period of
   the current time. The age of the response can also optionally be
   checked. Two new options -validity_period and -status_age added to
   ocsp utility.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * If signature or public key algorithm is unrecognized print out its
   OID rather that just UNKNOWN.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change OCSP_cert_to_id() to tolerate a NULL subject certificate and
   OCSP_cert_id_new() a NULL serialNumber. This allows a partial certificate
   ID to be generated from the issuer certificate alone which can then be
   passed to OCSP_id_issuer_cmp().

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New compilation option ASN1_ITEM_FUNCTIONS. This causes the new
   ASN1 modules to export functions returning ASN1_ITEM pointers
   instead of the ASN1_ITEM structures themselves. This adds several
   new macros which allow the underlying ASN1 function/structure to
   be accessed transparently. As a result code should not use ASN1_ITEM
   references directly (such as &amp;X509_it) but instead use the relevant
   macros (such as ASN1_ITEM_rptr(X509)). This option is to allow
   use of the new ASN1 code on platforms where exporting structures
   is problematical (for example in shared libraries) but exporting
   functions returning pointers to structures is not.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for overriding the generation of SSL/TLS session IDs.
   These callbacks can be registered either in an SSL_CTX or per SSL.
   The purpose of this is to allow applications to control, if they wish,
   the arbitrary values chosen for use as session IDs, particularly as it
   can be useful for session caching in multiple-server environments. A
   command-line switch for testing this (and any client code that wishes
   to use such a feature) has been added to "s_server".

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe, Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Modify mkdef.pl to recognise and parse preprocessor conditionals
   of the form &lt;tt&gt;\#if defined(...) || defined(...) || ...&lt;/tt&gt; and
   &lt;tt&gt;\#if !defined(...) \&amp;\&amp; !defined(...) \&amp;\&amp; ...&lt;/tt&gt;.  This also avoids
   the growing number of special cases it was previously handling.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make all configuration macros available for application by making
   sure they are available in opensslconf.h, by giving them names starting
   with &lt;tt&gt;OPENSSL_&lt;/tt&gt; to avoid conflicts with other packages and by making
   sure e_os2.h will cover all platform-specific cases together with
   opensslconf.h.
   Additionally, it is now possible to define configuration/platform-
   specific names (called "system identities").  In the C code, these
   are prefixed with &lt;tt&gt;OPENSSL_SYSNAME_&lt;/tt&gt;.  e_os2.h will create another
   macro with the name beginning with &lt;tt&gt;OPENSSL_SYS_&lt;/tt&gt;, which is determined
   from &lt;tt&gt;OPENSSL_SYSNAME_*&lt;/tt&gt; or compiler-specific macros depending on
   what is available.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * New option -set_serial to 'req' and 'x509' this allows the serial
   number to use to be specified on the command line. Previously self
   signed certificates were hard coded with serial number 0 and the
   CA options of 'x509' had to use a serial number in a file which was
   auto incremented.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New options to 'ca' utility to support V2 CRL entry extensions.
   Currently CRL reason, invalidity date and hold instruction are
   supported. Add new CRL extensions to V3 code and some new objects.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() this is used to
   disable standard block padding (aka PKCS#5 padding) in the EVP
   API, which was previously mandatory. This means that the data is
   not padded in any way and so the total length much be a multiple
   of the block size, otherwise an error occurs.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initial (incomplete) OCSP SSL support.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function OCSP_parse_url(). This splits up a URL into its host,
   port and path components: primarily to parse OCSP URLs. New -url
   option to ocsp utility.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New nonce behavior. The return value of OCSP_check_nonce() now
   reflects the various checks performed. Applications can decide
   whether to tolerate certain situations such as an absent nonce
   in a response when one was present in a request: the ocsp application
   just prints out a warning. New function OCSP_add1_basic_nonce()
   this is to allow responders to include a nonce in a response even if
   the request is nonce-less.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disable stdin buffering in &lt;tt&gt;load_cert()&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;apps/apps.c&lt;/tt&gt;) so that no certs are
   skipped when using openssl x509 multiple times on a single input file,
   e.g. &lt;tt&gt;(openssl x509 -out cert1; openssl x509 -out cert2) \&lt;certs&lt;/tt&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make ASN1_UTCTIME_set_string() and ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME_set_string()
   set string type: to handle setting ASN1_TIME structures. Fix ca
   utility to correctly initialize revocation date of CRLs.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New option SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE allows the server to override
   the clients preferred ciphersuites and rather use its own preferences.
   Should help to work around M$ SGC (Server Gated Cryptography) bug in
   Internet Explorer by ensuring unchanged hash method during stepup.
   (Also replaces the broken/deactivated SSL_OP_NON_EXPORT_FIRST option.)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make mkdef.pl recognise all DECLARE_ASN1 macros, change rijndael
   to aes and add a new 'exist' option to print out symbols that don't
   appear to exist.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Additional options to ocsp utility to allow flags to be set and
   additional certificates supplied.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the option -VAfile to 'openssl ocsp', so the user can give the
   OCSP client a number of certificate to only verify the response
   signature against.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Update Rijndael code to version 3.0 and change EVP AES ciphers to
   handle the new API. Currently only ECB, CBC modes supported. Add new
   AES OIDs.

   Add TLS AES ciphersuites as described in RFC3268, "Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)".  (In beta versions of OpenSSL 0.9.7, these were
   not enabled by default and were not part of the "ALL" ciphersuite
   alias because they were not yet official; they could be
   explicitly requested by specifying the "AESdraft" ciphersuite
   group alias.  In the final release of OpenSSL 0.9.7, the group
   alias is called "AES" and is part of "ALL".)

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie, Steve  Henson, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function OCSP_copy_nonce() to copy nonce value (if present) from
   request to response.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Functions for OCSP responders. OCSP_request_onereq_count(),
   OCSP_request_onereq_get0(), OCSP_onereq_get0_id() and OCSP_id_get0_info()
   extract information from a certificate request. OCSP_response_create()
   creates a response and optionally adds a basic response structure.
   OCSP_basic_add1_status() adds a complete single response to a basic
   response and returns the OCSP_SINGLERESP structure just added (to allow
   extensions to be included for example). OCSP_basic_add1_cert() adds a
   certificate to a basic response and OCSP_basic_sign() signs a basic
   response with various flags. New helper functions ASN1_TIME_check()
   (checks validity of ASN1_TIME structure) and ASN1_TIME_to_generalizedtime()
   (converts ASN1_TIME to GeneralizedTime).

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Various new functions. EVP_Digest() combines EVP_Digest{Init,Update,Final}()
   in a single operation. X509_get0_pubkey_bitstr() extracts the public_key
   structure from a certificate. X509_pubkey_digest() digests the public_key
   contents: this is used in various key identifiers.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make sk_sort() tolerate a NULL argument.

   *Steve Henson reported by Massimiliano Pala &lt;madwolf@comune.modena.it&gt;*

 * New OCSP verify flag OCSP_TRUSTOTHER. When set the "other" certificates
   passed by the function are trusted implicitly. If any of them signed the
   response then it is assumed to be valid and is not verified.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In PKCS7_set_type() initialise content_type in PKCS7_ENC_CONTENT
   to data. This was previously part of the PKCS7 ASN1 code. This
   was causing problems with OpenSSL created PKCS#12 and PKCS#7 structures.
   *Steve Henson, reported by Kenneth R. Robinette
                              &lt;support@securenetterm.com&gt;*

 * Add CRYPTO_push_info() and CRYPTO_pop_info() calls to new ASN1
   routines: without these tracing memory leaks is very painful.
   Fix leaks in PKCS12 and PKCS7 routines.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make X509_time_adj() cope with the new behaviour of ASN1_TIME_new().
   Previously it initialised the 'type' argument to V_ASN1_UTCTIME which
   effectively meant GeneralizedTime would never be used. Now it
   is initialised to -1 but X509_time_adj() now has to check the value
   and use ASN1_TIME_set() if the value is not V_ASN1_UTCTIME or
   V_ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME, without this it always uses GeneralizedTime.
   *Steve Henson, reported by Kenneth R. Robinette
                              &lt;support@securenetterm.com&gt;*

 * Fixes to BN_to_ASN1_INTEGER when bn is zero. This would previously
   result in a zero length in the ASN1_INTEGER structure which was
   not consistent with the structure when d2i_ASN1_INTEGER() was used
   and would cause ASN1_INTEGER_cmp() to fail. Enhance s2i_ASN1_INTEGER()
   to cope with hex and negative integers. Fix bug in i2a_ASN1_INTEGER()
   where it did not print out a minus for negative ASN1_INTEGER.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add summary printout to ocsp utility. The various functions which
   convert status values to strings have been renamed to:
   OCSP_response_status_str(), OCSP_cert_status_str() and
   OCSP_crl_reason_str() and are no longer static. New options
   to verify nonce values and to disable verification. OCSP response
   printout format cleaned up.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add additional OCSP certificate checks. These are those specified
   in RFC2560. This consists of two separate checks: the CA of the
   certificate being checked must either be the OCSP signer certificate
   or the issuer of the OCSP signer certificate. In the latter case the
   OCSP signer certificate must contain the OCSP signing extended key
   usage. This check is performed by attempting to match the OCSP
   signer or the OCSP signer CA to the issuerNameHash and issuerKeyHash
   in the OCSP_CERTID structures of the response.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initial OCSP certificate verification added to OCSP_basic_verify()
   and related routines. This uses the standard OpenSSL certificate
   verify routines to perform initial checks (just CA validity) and
   to obtain the certificate chain. Then additional checks will be
   performed on the chain. Currently the root CA is checked to see
   if it is explicitly trusted for OCSP signing. This is used to set
   a root CA as a global signing root: that is any certificate that
   chains to that CA is an acceptable OCSP signing certificate.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New '-extfile ...' option to 'openssl ca' for reading X.509v3
   extensions from a separate configuration file.
   As when reading extensions from the main configuration file,
   the '-extensions ...' option may be used for specifying the
   section to use.

   *Massimiliano Pala &lt;madwolf@comune.modena.it&gt;*

 * New OCSP utility. Allows OCSP requests to be generated or
   read. The request can be sent to a responder and the output
   parsed, outputted or printed in text form. Not complete yet:
   still needs to check the OCSP response validity.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New subcommands for 'openssl ca':
   &lt;tt&gt;openssl ca -status \&lt;serial\&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; prints the status of the cert with
   the given serial number (according to the index file).
   &lt;tt&gt;openssl ca -updatedb&lt;/tt&gt; updates the expiry status of certificates
   in the index file.

   *Massimiliano Pala &lt;madwolf@comune.modena.it&gt;*

 * New '-newreq-nodes' command option to CA.pl.  This is like
   '-newreq', but calls 'openssl req' with the '-nodes' option
   so that the resulting key is not encrypted.

   *Damien Miller &lt;djm@mindrot.org&gt;*

 * New configuration for the GNU Hurd.

   *Jonathan Bartlett &lt;johnnyb@wolfram.com&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Initial code to implement OCSP basic response verify. This
   is currently incomplete. Currently just finds the signer's
   certificate and verifies the signature on the response.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New SSLeay_version code SSLEAY_DIR to determine the compiled-in
   value of OPENSSLDIR.  This is available via the new '-d' option
   to 'openssl version', and is also included in 'openssl version -a'.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Allowing defining memory allocation callbacks that will be given
   file name and line number information in additional arguments
   (a &lt;tt&gt;const char*&lt;/tt&gt; and an int).  The basic functionality remains, as
   well as the original possibility to just replace malloc(),
   realloc() and free() by functions that do not know about these
   additional arguments.  To register and find out the current
   settings for extended allocation functions, the following
   functions are provided:
@iverbatim 
    CRYPTO_set_mem_ex_functions
    CRYPTO_set_locked_mem_ex_functions
    CRYPTO_get_mem_ex_functions
    CRYPTO_get_locked_mem_ex_functions
@endiverbatim
   These work the same way as CRYPTO_set_mem_functions and friends.
   &lt;tt&gt;CRYPTO_get_[locked_]mem_functions&lt;/tt&gt; now writes 0 where such an
   extended allocation function is enabled.
   Similarly, &lt;tt&gt;CRYPTO_get_[locked_]mem_ex_functions&lt;/tt&gt; writes 0 where
   a conventional allocation function is enabled.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Finish off removing the remaining LHASH function pointer casts.
   There should no longer be any prototype-casting required when using
   the LHASH abstraction, and any casts that remain are "bugs". See
   the callback types and macros at the head of lhash.h for details
   (and "OBJ_cleanup" in crypto/objects/obj_dat.c as an example).

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add automatic query of EGD sockets in RAND_poll() for the unix variant.
   If /dev/[u]random devices are not available or do not return enough
   entropy, EGD style sockets (served by EGD or PRNGD) will automatically
   be queried.
   The locations /var/run/egd-pool, /dev/egd-pool, /etc/egd-pool, and
   /etc/entropy will be queried once each in this sequence, querying stops
   when enough entropy was collected without querying more sockets.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the Unix RAND_poll() variant to be able to poll several
   random devices, as specified by DEVRANDOM, until a sufficient amount
   of data has been collected.   We spend at most 10 ms on each file
   (select timeout) and read in non-blocking mode.  DEVRANDOM now
   defaults to the list "/dev/urandom", "/dev/random", "/dev/srandom"
   (previously it was just the string "/dev/urandom"), so on typical
   platforms the 10 ms delay will never occur.
   Also separate out the Unix variant to its own file, rand_unix.c.
   For VMS, there's a currently-empty rand_vms.c.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Move OCSP client related routines to ocsp_cl.c. These
   provide utility functions which an application needing
   to issue a request to an OCSP responder and analyse the
   response will typically need: as opposed to those which an
   OCSP responder itself would need which will be added later.

   OCSP_request_sign() signs an OCSP request with an API similar
   to PKCS7_sign(). OCSP_response_status() returns status of OCSP
   response. OCSP_response_get1_basic() extracts basic response
   from response. OCSP_resp_find_status(): finds and extracts status
   information from an OCSP_CERTID structure (which will be created
   when the request structure is built). These are built from lower
   level functions which work on OCSP_SINGLERESP structures but
   won't normally be used unless the application wishes to examine
   extensions in the OCSP response for example.

   Replace nonce routines with a pair of functions.
   OCSP_request_add1_nonce() adds a nonce value and optionally
   generates a random value. OCSP_check_nonce() checks the
   validity of the nonce in an OCSP response.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change function OCSP_request_add() to OCSP_request_add0_id().
   This doesn't copy the supplied OCSP_CERTID and avoids the
   need to free up the newly created id. Change return type
   to OCSP_ONEREQ to return the internal OCSP_ONEREQ structure.
   This can then be used to add extensions to the request.
   Deleted OCSP_request_new(), since most of its functionality
   is now in OCSP_REQUEST_new() (and the case insensitive name
   clash) apart from the ability to set the request name which
   will be added elsewhere.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Update OCSP API. Remove obsolete extensions argument from
   various functions. Extensions are now handled using the new
   OCSP extension code. New simple OCSP HTTP function which
   can be used to send requests and parse the response.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix the PKCS#7 (S/MIME) code to work with new ASN1. Two new
   ASN1_ITEM structures help with sign and verify. PKCS7_ATTR_SIGN
   uses the special reorder version of SET OF to sort the attributes
   and reorder them to match the encoded order. This resolves a long
   standing problem: a verify on a PKCS7 structure just after signing
   it used to fail because the attribute order did not match the
   encoded order. PKCS7_ATTR_VERIFY does not reorder the attributes:
   it uses the received order. This is necessary to tolerate some broken
   software that does not order SET OF. This is handled by encoding
   as a SEQUENCE OF but using implicit tagging (with UNIVERSAL class)
   to produce the required SET OF.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Have mk1mf.pl generate the macros OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO and
   OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSL and use them appropriately in the header
   files to get correct declarations of the ASN.1 item variables.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rewrite of PKCS#12 code to use new ASN1 functionality. Replace many
   PKCS#12 macros with real functions. Fix two unrelated ASN1 bugs:
   asn1_check_tlen() would sometimes attempt to use 'ctx' when it was
   NULL and ASN1_TYPE was not dereferenced properly in asn1_ex_c2i().
   New ASN1 macro: DECLARE_ASN1_ITEM() which just declares the relevant
   ASN1_ITEM and no wrapper functions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New functions or ASN1_item_d2i_fp() and ASN1_item_d2i_bio(). These
   replace the old function pointer based I/O routines. Change most of
   the &lt;tt&gt;*_d2i_bio()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;*_d2i_fp()&lt;/tt&gt; functions to use these.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Enhance mkdef.pl to be more accepting about spacing in C preprocessor
   lines, recognize more "algorithms" that can be deselected, and make
   it complain about algorithm deselection that isn't recognised.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * New ASN1 functions to handle dup, sign, verify, digest, pack and
   unpack operations in terms of ASN1_ITEM. Modify existing wrappers
   to use new functions. Add NO_ASN1_OLD which can be set to remove
   some old style ASN1 functions: this can be used to determine if old
   code will still work when these eventually go away.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New extension functions for OCSP structures, these follow the
   same conventions as certificates and CRLs.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function X509V3_add1_i2d(). This automatically encodes and
   adds an extension. Its behaviour can be customised with various
   flags to append, replace or delete. Various wrappers added for
   certificates and CRLs.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix to avoid calling the underlying ASN1 print routine when
   an extension cannot be parsed. Correct a typo in the
   OCSP_SERVICELOC extension. Tidy up print OCSP format.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make mkdef.pl parse some of the ASN1 macros and add appropriate
   entries for variables.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add functionality to &lt;tt&gt;apps/openssl.c&lt;/tt&gt; for detecting locking
   problems: As the program is single-threaded, all we have
   to do is register a locking callback using an array for
   storing which locks are currently held by the program.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use a lock around the call to CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() in
   SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_idx(), which is used in
   ssl_verify_cert_chain() and thus can be called at any time
   during TLS/SSL handshakes so that thread-safety is essential.
   Unfortunately, the ex_data design is not at all suited
   for multi-threaded use, so it probably should be abolished.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added Broadcom "ubsec" ENGINE to OpenSSL.

   &lt;em&gt;Broadcom, tweaked and integrated by Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Move common extension printing code to new function
   X509V3_print_extensions(). Reorganise OCSP print routines and
   implement some needed OCSP ASN1 functions. Add OCSP extensions.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function X509_signature_print() to remove duplication in some
   print routines.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a special meaning when SET OF and SEQUENCE OF flags are both
   set (this was treated exactly the same as SET OF previously). This
   is used to reorder the STACK representing the structure to match the
   encoding. This will be used to get round a problem where a PKCS7
   structure which was signed could not be verified because the STACK
   order did not reflect the encoded order.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Reimplement the OCSP ASN1 module using the new code.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Update the X509V3 code to permit the use of an ASN1_ITEM structure
   for its ASN1 operations. The old style function pointers still exist
   for now but they will eventually go away.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Merge in replacement ASN1 code from the ASN1 branch. This almost
   completely replaces the old ASN1 functionality with a table driven
   encoder and decoder which interprets an ASN1_ITEM structure describing
   the ASN1 module. Compatibility with the existing ASN1 API (i2d,d2i) is
   largely maintained. Almost all of the old asn1_mac.h macro based ASN1
   has also been converted to the new form.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change BN_mod_exp_recp so that negative moduli are tolerated
   (the sign is ignored).  Similarly, ignore the sign in BN_MONT_CTX_set
   so that BN_mod_exp_mont and BN_mod_exp_mont_word work
   for negative moduli.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix BN_uadd and BN_usub: Always return non-negative results instead
   of not touching the result's sign bit.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * BN_div bugfix: If the result is 0, the sign (res-&gt;neg) must not be
   set.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Changed the LHASH code to use prototypes for callbacks, and created
   macros to declare and implement thin (optionally static) functions
   that provide type-safety and avoid function pointer casting for the
   type-specific callbacks.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added Kerberos Cipher Suites to be used with TLS, as written in
   RFC 2712.
   *Veers Staats &lt;staatsvr@asc.hpc.mil&gt;,
   Jeffrey Altman &lt;jaltman@columbia.edu&gt;, via Richard Levitte*

 * Reformat the FAQ so the different questions and answers can be divided
   in sections depending on the subject.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Have the zlib compression code load ZLIB.DLL dynamically under
   Windows.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function BN_mod_sqrt for computing square roots modulo a prime
   (using the probabilistic Tonelli-Shanks algorithm unless
   p == 3 (mod 4)  or  p == 5 (mod 8),  which are cases that can
   be handled deterministically).

   *Lenka Fibikova &lt;fibikova@exp-math.uni-essen.de&gt;, Bodo Moeller*

 * Make BN_mod_inverse faster by explicitly handling small quotients
   in the Euclid loop. (Speed gain about 20% for small moduli [256 or
   512 bits], about 30% for larger ones [1024 or 2048 bits].)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function BN_kronecker.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix BN_gcd so that it works on negative inputs; the result is
   positive unless both parameters are zero.
   Previously something reasonably close to an infinite loop was
   possible because numbers could be growing instead of shrinking
   in the implementation of Euclid's algorithm.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix BN_is_word() and BN_is_one() macros to take into account the
   sign of the number in question.

   Fix BN_is_word(a,w) to work correctly for w == 0.

   The old BN_is_word(a,w) macro is now called BN_abs_is_word(a,w)
   because its test if the absolute value of 'a' equals 'w'.
   Note that BN_abs_is_word does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; handle w == 0 reliably;
   it exists mostly for use in the implementations of BN_is_zero(),
   BN_is_one(), and BN_is_word().

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New function BN_swap.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use BN_nnmod instead of BN_mod in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c so that
   the exponentiation functions are more likely to produce reasonable
   results on negative inputs.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change BN_mod_mul so that the result is always non-negative.
   Previously, it could be negative if one of the factors was negative;
   I don't think anyone really wanted that behaviour.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Move &lt;tt&gt;BN_mod_...&lt;/tt&gt; functions into new file &lt;tt&gt;crypto/bn/bn_mod.c&lt;/tt&gt;
   (except for exponentiation, which stays in &lt;tt&gt;crypto/bn/bn_exp.c&lt;/tt&gt;,
   and &lt;tt&gt;BN_mod_mul_reciprocal&lt;/tt&gt;, which stays in &lt;tt&gt;crypto/bn/bn_recp.c&lt;/tt&gt;)
   and add new functions:
@iverbatim 
    BN_nnmod
    BN_mod_sqr
    BN_mod_add
    BN_mod_add_quick
    BN_mod_sub
    BN_mod_sub_quick
    BN_mod_lshift1
    BN_mod_lshift1_quick
    BN_mod_lshift
    BN_mod_lshift_quick
@endiverbatim
   These functions always generate non-negative results.

   &lt;tt&gt;BN_nnmod&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise is &lt;tt&gt;like BN_mod&lt;/tt&gt; (if &lt;tt&gt;BN_mod&lt;/tt&gt; computes a remainder &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt;
   such that &lt;tt&gt;|m| \&lt; r \&lt; 0&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;BN_nnmod&lt;/tt&gt; will output &lt;tt&gt;rem + |m|&lt;/tt&gt; instead).

   &lt;tt&gt;BN_mod_XXX_quick(r, a, [b,] m)&lt;/tt&gt; generates the same result as
   &lt;tt&gt;BN_mod_XXX(r, a, [b,] m, ctx)&lt;/tt&gt;, but requires that &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; [and  &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;]
   be reduced modulo &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt;.

   *Lenka Fibikova &lt;fibikova@exp-math.uni-essen.de&gt;, Bodo Moeller*

















 * In 'openssl passwd', verify passwords read from the terminal
   unless the '-salt' option is used (which usually means that
   verification would just waste user's time since the resulting
   hash is going to be compared with some given password hash)
   or the new '-noverify' option is used.

   This is an incompatible change, but it does not affect
   non-interactive use of 'openssl passwd' (passwords on the command
   line, '-stdin' option, '-in ...' option) and thus should not
   cause any problems.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Remove all references to RSAref, since there's no more need for it.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make DSO load along a path given through an environment variable
   (SHLIB_PATH) with shl_load().

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Constify the ENGINE code as a result of BIGNUM constification.
   Also constify the RSA code and most things related to it.  In a
   few places, most notable in the depth of the ASN.1 code, ugly
   casts back to non-const were required (to be solved at a later
   time)

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make it so the openssl application has all engines loaded by default.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Constify the BIGNUM routines a little more.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add the following functions:
@iverbatim 
    ENGINE_load_cswift()
    ENGINE_load_chil()
    ENGINE_load_atalla()
    ENGINE_load_nuron()
    ENGINE_load_builtin_engines()
@endiverbatim
   That way, an application can itself choose if external engines that
   are built-in in OpenSSL shall ever be used or not.  The benefit is
   that applications won't have to be linked with libdl or other dso
   libraries unless it's really needed.

   Changed 'openssl engine' to load all engines on demand.
   Changed the engine header files to avoid the duplication of some
   declarations (they differed!).

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * 'openssl engine' can now list capabilities.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Better error reporting in 'openssl engine'.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Never call load_dh_param(NULL) in s_server.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add engine application.  It can currently list engines by name and
   identity, and test if they are actually available.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Improve RPM specification file by forcing symbolic linking and making
   sure the installed documentation is also owned by root.root.

   *Damien Miller &lt;djm@mindrot.org&gt;*

 * Give the OpenSSL applications more possibilities to make use of
   keys (public as well as private) handled by engines.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add OCSP code that comes from CertCo.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add VMS support for the Rijndael code.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added untested support for Nuron crypto accelerator.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add support for external cryptographic devices.  This code was
   previously distributed separately as the "engine" branch.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe, Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rework the filename-translation in the DSO code. It is now possible to
   have far greater control over how a "name" is turned into a filename
   depending on the operating environment and any oddities about the
   different shared library filenames on each system.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Support threads on FreeBSD-elf in Configure.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for SHA1 assembly problem with MASM: it produces
   warnings about corrupt line number information when assembling
   with debugging information. This is caused by the overlapping
   of two sections.

   *Bernd Matthes &lt;mainbug@celocom.de&gt;, Steve Henson*

 * NCONF changes.
   NCONF_get_number() has no error checking at all.  As a replacement,
   NCONF_get_number_e() is defined (&lt;tt&gt;_e&lt;/tt&gt; for "error checking") and is
   promoted strongly.  The old NCONF_get_number is kept around for
   binary backward compatibility.
   Make it possible for methods to load from something other than a BIO,
   by providing a function pointer that is given a name instead of a BIO.
   For example, this could be used to load configuration data from an
   LDAP server.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for non blocking accept BIOs. Added new I/O special reason
   BIO_RR_ACCEPT to cover this case. Previously use of accept BIOs
   with non blocking I/O was not possible because no retry code was
   implemented. Also added new SSL code SSL_WANT_ACCEPT to cover
   this case.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added the beginnings of Rijndael support.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for bug in DirectoryString mask setting. Add support for
   X509_NAME_print_ex() in 'req' and X509_print_ex() function
   to allow certificate printing to more controllable, additional
   'certopt' option to 'x509' to allow new printing options to be
   set.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Clean old EAY MD5 hack from e_os.h.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md149 Changes between 0.9.6l and 0.9.6m  [17 Mar 2004]

 * Fix null-pointer assignment in do_change_cipher_spec() revealed
   by using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0079">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2004-0079</a>" &gt;CVE-2004-0079&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Joe Orton, Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md150 Changes between 0.9.6k and 0.9.6l  [04 Nov 2003]

 * Fix additional bug revealed by the NISCC test suite:

   Stop bug triggering large recursion when presented with
   certain ASN.1 tags (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0851">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0851</a>" &gt;CVE-2003-0851&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md151 Changes between 0.9.6j and 0.9.6k  [30 Sep 2003]

 * Fix various bugs revealed by running the NISCC test suite:

   Stop out of bounds reads in the ASN1 code when presented with
   invalid tags (CVE-2003-0543 and CVE-2003-0544).

   If verify callback ignores invalid public key errors don't try to check
   certificate signature with the NULL public key.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In ssl3_accept() (ssl/s3_srvr.c) only accept a client certificate
   if the server requested one: as stated in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0
   specifications.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In ssl3_get_client_hello() (ssl/s3_srvr.c), tolerate additional
   extra data after the compression methods not only for TLS 1.0
   but also for SSL 3.0 (as required by the specification).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Matthias Loepfe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change X509_certificate_type() to mark the key as exported/exportable
   when it's 512 &lt;em&gt;bits&lt;/em&gt; long, not 512 bytes.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md152 Changes between 0.9.6i and 0.9.6j  [10 Apr 2003]

 * Countermeasure against the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of
   Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding: treat
   a protocol version number mismatch like a decryption error
   in ssl3_get_client_key_exchange (ssl/s3_srvr.c).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Turn on RSA blinding by default in the default implementation
   to avoid a timing attack. Applications that don't want it can call
   RSA_blinding_off() or use the new flag RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING.
   They would be ill-advised to do so in most cases.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie, Steve Henson, Geoff Thorpe, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change RSA blinding code so that it works when the PRNG is not
   seeded (in this case, the secret RSA exponent is abused as
   an unpredictable seed &amp;ndash; if it is not unpredictable, there
   is no point in blinding anyway).  Make RSA blinding thread-safe
   by remembering the creator's thread ID in rsa-&gt;blinding and
   having all other threads use local one-time blinding factors
   (this requires more computation than sharing rsa-&gt;blinding, but
   avoids excessive locking; and if an RSA object is not shared
   between threads, blinding will still be very fast).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md153 Changes between 0.9.6h and 0.9.6i  [19 Feb 2003]

 * In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
   via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrect
   block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
   against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
   between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0078">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2003-0078</a>" &gt;CVE-2003-0078&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Brice Canvel (EPFL),
   Alain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and
   Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL, Ilion)&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md154 Changes between 0.9.6g and 0.9.6h  [5 Dec 2002]

 * New function OPENSSL_cleanse(), which is used to cleanse a section of
   memory from its contents.  This is done with a counter that will
   place alternating values in each byte.  This can be used to solve
   two issues: 1) the removal of calls to memset() by highly optimizing
   compilers, and 2) cleansing with other values than 0, since those can
   be read through on certain media, for example a swap space on disk.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Bugfix: client side session caching did not work with external caching,
   because the session-&gt;cipher setting was not restored when reloading
   from the external cache. This problem was masked, when
   SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG (part of SSL_OP_ALL) was set.
   (Found by Steve Haslam &lt;steve@araqnid.ddts.net&gt;.)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix client_certificate (ssl/s2_clnt.c): The permissible total
   length of the REQUEST-CERTIFICATE message is 18 .. 34, not 17 .. 33.

   *Zeev Lieber &lt;zeev-l@yahoo.com&gt;*

 * Undo an undocumented change introduced in 0.9.6e which caused
   repeated calls to OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers() and
   OpenSSL_add_all_digests() to be ignored, even after calling
   EVP_cleanup().

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change the default configuration reader to deal with last line not
   being properly terminated.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change X509_NAME_cmp() so it applies the special rules on handling
   DN values that are of type PrintableString, as well as RDNs of type
   emailAddress where the value has the type ia5String.

   *stefank@valicert.com via Richard Levitte*

 * Add a SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE flag to take over half
   the job SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP was inconsistently
   doing, define a new flag (SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL) to be
   the bitwise-OR of the two for use by the majority of applications
   wanting this behaviour, and update the docs. The documented
   behaviour and actual behaviour were inconsistent and had been
   changing anyway, so this is more a bug-fix than a behavioural
   change.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe, diagnosed by Nadav Har'El&lt;/em&gt;

 * Don't impose a 16-byte length minimum on session IDs in ssl/s3_clnt.c
   (the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 specifications allow any length up to 32 bytes).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix initialization code race conditions in
           SSLv23_method(),  SSLv23_client_method(),   SSLv23_server_method(),
           SSLv2_method(),   SSLv2_client_method(),    SSLv2_server_method(),
           SSLv3_method(),   SSLv3_client_method(),    SSLv3_server_method(),
           TLSv1_method(),   TLSv1_client_method(),    TLSv1_server_method(),
           ssl2_get_cipher_by_char(),
           ssl3_get_cipher_by_char().

   *Patrick McCormick &lt;patrick@tellme.com&gt;, Bodo Moeller*

 * Reorder cleanup sequence in SSL_CTX_free(): only remove the ex_data after
   the cached sessions are flushed, as the remove_cb() might use ex_data
   contents. Bug found by Sam Varshavchik &lt;mrsam@courier-mta.com&gt;
   (see [openssl.org #212]).

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe, Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix typo in OBJ_txt2obj which incorrectly passed the content
   length, instead of the encoding length to d2i_ASN1_OBJECT.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md155 Changes between 0.9.6f and 0.9.6g  [9 Aug 2002]

 * [In 0.9.6g-engine release:]
   Fix crypto/engine/vendor_defns/cswift.h for WIN32 (use &lt;tt&gt;_stdcall&lt;/tt&gt;).

   *Lynn Gazis &lt;lgazis@rainbow.com&gt;*

@subsection autotoc_md156 Changes between 0.9.6e and 0.9.6f  [8 Aug 2002]

 * Fix ASN1 checks. Check for overflow by comparing with LONG_MAX
   and get fix the header length calculation.
   *Florian Weimer &lt;Weimer@CERT.Uni-Stuttgart.DE&gt;,
   Alon Kantor &lt;alonk@checkpoint.com&gt; (and others), Steve Henson*

 * Use proper error handling instead of 'assertions' in buffer
   overflow checks added in 0.9.6e.  This prevents DoS (the
   assertions could call abort()).

   *Arne Ansper &lt;arne@ats.cyber.ee&gt;, Bodo Moeller*

@subsection autotoc_md157 Changes between 0.9.6d and 0.9.6e  [30 Jul 2002]

 * Add various sanity checks to asn1_get_length() to reject
   the ASN1 length bytes if they exceed sizeof(long), will appear
   negative or the content length exceeds the length of the
   supplied buffer.

   *Steve Henson, Adi Stav &lt;stav@mercury.co.il&gt;, James Yonan &lt;jim@ntlp.com&gt;*

 * Fix cipher selection routines: ciphers without encryption had no flags
   for the cipher strength set and where therefore not handled correctly
   by the selection routines (PR #130).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix EVP_dsa_sha macro.

   &lt;em&gt;Nils Larsch&lt;/em&gt;

 * New option
        SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
   for disabling the SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability countermeasure
   that was added in OpenSSL 0.9.6d.

   As the countermeasure turned out to be incompatible with some
   broken SSL implementations, the new option is part of SSL_OP_ALL.
   SSL_OP_ALL is usually employed when compatibility with weird SSL
   implementations is desired (e.g. '-bugs' option to 's_client' and
   's_server'), so the new option is automatically set in many
   applications.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Changes in security patch:

   Changes marked "(CHATS)" were sponsored by the Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force Research Laboratory,
   Air Force Materiel Command, USAF, under agreement number
   F30602-01-2-0537.

 * Add various sanity checks to asn1_get_length() to reject
   the ASN1 length bytes if they exceed sizeof(long), will appear
   negative or the content length exceeds the length of the
   supplied buffer. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0659">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0659</a>" &gt;CVE-2002-0659&lt;/a&gt;)

   *Steve Henson, Adi Stav &lt;stav@mercury.co.il&gt;, James Yonan &lt;jim@ntlp.com&gt;*

 * Assertions for various potential buffer overflows, not known to
   happen in practice.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Various temporary buffers to hold ASCII versions of integers were
   too small for 64 bit platforms. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0655">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0655</a>" &gt;CVE-2002-0655&lt;/a&gt;)
   *Matthew Byng-Maddick &lt;mbm@aldigital.co.uk&gt; and Ben Laurie (CHATS)&gt;*

 * Remote buffer overflow in SSL3 protocol - an attacker could
   supply an oversized session ID to a client. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0656">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0656</a>" &gt;CVE-2002-0656&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

 * Remote buffer overflow in SSL2 protocol - an attacker could
   supply an oversized client master key. (&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0656">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2002-0656</a>" &gt;CVE-2002-0656&lt;/a&gt;)

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie (CHATS)&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md158 Changes between 0.9.6c and 0.9.6d  [9 May 2002]

 * Fix crypto/asn1/a_sign.c so that 'parameters' is omitted (not
   encoded as NULL) with id-dsa-with-sha1.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;; problem pointed out by Bodo Moeller*

 * Check various &lt;tt&gt;X509_...()&lt;/tt&gt; return values in &lt;tt&gt;apps/req.c&lt;/tt&gt;.

   *Nils Larsch &lt;nla@trustcenter.de&gt;*

 * Fix BASE64 decode (EVP_DecodeUpdate) for data with CR/LF ended lines:
   an end-of-file condition would erroneously be flagged, when the CRLF
   was just at the end of a processed block. The bug was discovered when
   processing data through a buffering memory BIO handing the data to a
   BASE64-decoding BIO. Bug fund and patch submitted by Pavel Tsekov
   &lt;ptsekov@syntrex.com&gt; and Nedelcho Stanev.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Implement a countermeasure against a vulnerability recently found
   in CBC ciphersuites in SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0: Send an empty fragment
   before application data chunks to avoid the use of known IVs
   with data potentially chosen by the attacker.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix length checks in ssl3_get_client_hello().

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * TLS/SSL library bugfix: use s-&gt;s3-&gt;in_read_app_data differently
   to prevent ssl3_read_internal() from incorrectly assuming that
   ssl3_read_bytes() found application data while handshake
   processing was enabled when in fact s-&gt;s3-&gt;in_read_app_data was
   merely automatically cleared during the initial handshake.

   *Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Arne Ansper &lt;arne@ats.cyber.ee&gt;*

 * Fix object definitions for Private and Enterprise: they were not
   recognized in their shortname (=lowercase) representation. Extend
   obj_dat.pl to issue an error when using undefined keywords instead
   of silently ignoring the problem (Svenning Sorensen
   &lt;sss@sss.dnsalias.net&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix DH_generate_parameters() so that it works for 'non-standard'
   generators, i.e. generators other than 2 and 5.  (Previously, the
   code did not properly initialise the 'add' and 'rem' values to
   BN_generate_prime().)

   In the new general case, we do not insist that 'generator' is
   actually a primitive root: This requirement is rather pointless;
   a generator of the order-q subgroup is just as good, if not
   better.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Map new X509 verification errors to alerts. Discovered and submitted by
   Tom Wu &lt;tom@arcot.com&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix ssl3_pending() (ssl/s3_lib.c) to prevent SSL_pending() from
   returning non-zero before the data has been completely received
   when using non-blocking I/O.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by John Hughes&lt;/em&gt;

 * Some of the ciphers missed the strength entry (SSL_LOW etc).

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie, Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix bug in SSL_clear(): bad sessions were not removed (found by
   Yoram Zahavi &lt;YoramZ@gilian.com&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add information about CygWin 1.3 and on, and preserve proper
   configuration for the versions before that.

   *Corinna Vinschen &lt;vinschen@redhat.com&gt; and Richard Levitte*

 * Make removal from session cache (SSL_CTX_remove_session()) more robust:
   check whether we deal with a copy of a session and do not delete from
   the cache in this case. Problem reported by "Izhar Shoshani Levi"
   &lt;izhar@checkpoint.com&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Do not store session data into the internal session cache, if it
   is never intended to be looked up (SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP
   flag is set). Proposed by Aslam &lt;aslam@funk.com&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Have ASN1_BIT_STRING_set_bit() really clear a bit when the requested
   value is 0.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * [In 0.9.6d-engine release:]
   Fix a crashbug and a logic bug in hwcrhk_load_pubkey().

   *Toomas Kiisk &lt;vix@cyber.ee&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Add the configuration target linux-s390x.

   *Neale Ferguson &lt;Neale.Ferguson@SoftwareAG-USA.com&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * The earlier bugfix for the SSL3_ST_SW_HELLO_REQ_C case of
   ssl3_accept (ssl/s3_srvr.c) incorrectly used a local flag
   variable as an indication that a ClientHello message has been
   received.  As the flag value will be lost between multiple
   invocations of ssl3_accept when using non-blocking I/O, the
   function may not be aware that a handshake has actually taken
   place, thus preventing a new session from being added to the
   session cache.

   To avoid this problem, we now set s-&gt;new_session to 2 instead of
   using a local variable.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Bugfix: Return -1 from ssl3_get_server_done (ssl3/s3_clnt.c)
   if the SSL_R_LENGTH_MISMATCH error is detected.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New 'shared_ldflag' column in Configure platform table.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix EVP_CIPHER_mode macro.

   *"Dan S. Camper" &lt;dan@bti.net&gt;*

 * Fix ssl3_read_bytes (ssl/s3_pkt.c): To ignore messages of unknown
   type, we must throw them away by setting rr-&gt;length to 0.

   *D P Chang &lt;dpc@qualys.com&gt;*

@subsection autotoc_md159 Changes between 0.9.6b and 0.9.6c  [21 dec 2001]

 * Fix BN_rand_range bug pointed out by Dominikus Scherkl
   &lt;Dominikus.Scherkl@biodata.com&gt;.  (The previous implementation
   worked incorrectly for those cases where range = &lt;tt&gt;10..._2&lt;/tt&gt;  and
   &lt;tt&gt;3*range&lt;/tt&gt;  is two bits longer than  range.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Only add signing time to PKCS7 structures if it is not already
   present.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix crypto/objects/objects.h: "ld-ce" should be "id-ce",
   OBJ_ld_ce should be OBJ_id_ce.
   Also some ip-pda OIDs in crypto/objects/objects.txt were
   incorrect (cf. RFC 3039).

   &lt;em&gt;Matt Cooper, Frederic Giudicelli, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Release CRYPTO_LOCK_DYNLOCK when CRYPTO_destroy_dynlockid()
   returns early because it has nothing to do.

   *Andy Schneider &lt;andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk&gt;*

 * [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
   Fix mutex callback return values in crypto/engine/hw_ncipher.c.

   *Andy Schneider &lt;andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk&gt;*

 * [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
   Add support for Cryptographic Appliance's keyserver technology.
   (Use engine 'keyclient')

   &lt;em&gt;Cryptographic Appliances and Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a configuration entry for OS/390 Unix.  The C compiler 'c89'
   is called via tools/c89.sh because arguments have to be
   rearranged (all '-L' options must appear before the first object
   modules).

   *Richard Shapiro &lt;rshapiro@abinitio.com&gt;*

 * [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
   Add support for Broadcom crypto accelerator cards, backported
   from 0.9.7.

   *Broadcom, Nalin Dahyabhai &lt;nalin@redhat.com&gt;, Mark Cox*

 * [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
   Add support for SureWare crypto accelerator cards from
   Baltimore Technologies.  (Use engine 'sureware')

   &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Technologies and Mark Cox&lt;/em&gt;

 * [In 0.9.6c-engine release:]
   Add support for crypto accelerator cards from Accelerated
   Encryption Processing, www.aep.ie.  (Use engine 'aep')

   &lt;em&gt;AEP Inc. and Mark Cox&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a configuration entry for gcc on UnixWare.

   *Gary Benson &lt;gbenson@redhat.com&gt;*

 * Change ssl/s2_clnt.c and ssl/s2_srvr.c so that received handshake
   messages are stored in a single piece (fixed-length part and
   variable-length part combined) and fix various bugs found on the way.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disable caching in BIO_gethostbyname(), directly use gethostbyname()
   instead.  BIO_gethostbyname() does not know what timeouts are
   appropriate, so entries would stay in cache even when they have
   become invalid.
   *Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Rich Salz &lt;rsalz@zolera.com&gt;*

 * Change ssl23_get_client_hello (ssl/s23_srvr.c) behaviour when
   faced with a pathologically small ClientHello fragment that does
   not contain client_version: Instead of aborting with an error,
   simply choose the highest available protocol version (i.e.,
   TLS 1.0 unless it is disabled).  In practice, ClientHello
   messages are never sent like this, but this change gives us
   strictly correct behaviour at least for TLS.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix SSL handshake functions and SSL_clear() such that SSL_clear()
   never resets s-&gt;method to s-&gt;ctx-&gt;method when called from within
   one of the SSL handshake functions.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller; problem pointed out by Niko Baric&lt;/em&gt;

 * In ssl3_get_client_hello (ssl/s3_srvr.c), generate a fatal alert
   (sent using the client's version number) if client_version is
   smaller than the protocol version in use.  Also change
   ssl23_get_client_hello (ssl/s23_srvr.c) to select TLS 1.0 if
   the client demanded SSL 3.0 but only TLS 1.0 is enabled; then
   the client will at least see that alert.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix ssl3_get_message (ssl/s3_both.c) to handle message fragmentation
   correctly.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid infinite loop in ssl3_get_message (ssl/s3_both.c) if a
   client receives HelloRequest while in a handshake.

   *Bodo Moeller; bug noticed by Andy Schneider &lt;andy.schneider@bjss.co.uk&gt;*

 * Bugfix in ssl3_accept (ssl/s3_srvr.c): Case SSL3_ST_SW_HELLO_REQ_C
   should end in 'break', not 'goto end' which circumvents various
   cleanups done in state SSL_ST_OK.   But session related stuff
   must be disabled for SSL_ST_OK in the case that we just sent a
   HelloRequest.

   Also avoid some overhead by not calling ssl_init_wbio_buffer()
   before just sending a HelloRequest.

   *Bodo Moeller, Eric Rescorla &lt;ekr@rtfm.com&gt;*

 * Fix ssl/s3_enc.c, ssl/t1_enc.c and ssl/s3_pkt.c so that we don't
   reveal whether illegal block cipher padding was found or a MAC
   verification error occurred.  (Neither SSLerr() codes nor alerts
   are directly visible to potential attackers, but the information
   may leak via logfiles.)

   Similar changes are not required for the SSL 2.0 implementation
   because the number of padding bytes is sent in clear for SSL 2.0,
   and the extra bytes are just ignored.  However ssl/s2_pkt.c
   failed to verify that the purported number of padding bytes is in
   the legal range.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add OpenUNIX-8 support including shared libraries
   (Boyd Lynn Gerber &lt;gerberb@zenez.com&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Improve RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_OAEP() check again to avoid
   'wristwatch attack' using huge encoding parameters (cf.
   James H. Manger's CRYPTO 2001 paper).  Note that the
   RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING case of RSA_private_decrypt() does not use
   encoding parameters and hence was not vulnerable.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * BN_sqr() bug fix.

   *Ulf Möller, reported by Jim Ellis &lt;jim.ellis@cavium.com&gt;*

 * Rabin-Miller test analyses assume uniformly distributed witnesses,
   so use BN_pseudo_rand_range() instead of using BN_pseudo_rand()
   followed by modular reduction.

   *Bodo Moeller; pointed out by Adam Young &lt;AYoung1@NCSUS.JNJ.COM&gt;*

 * Add BN_pseudo_rand_range() with obvious functionality: BN_rand_range()
   equivalent based on BN_pseudo_rand() instead of BN_rand().

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * s3_srvr.c: allow sending of large client certificate lists (&gt; 16 kB).
   This function was broken, as the check for a new client hello message
   to handle SGC did not allow these large messages.
   (Tracked down by "Douglas E. Engert" &lt;deengert@anl.gov&gt;.)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add alert descriptions for TLSv1 to &lt;tt&gt;SSL_alert_desc_string[_long]()&lt;/tt&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix buggy behaviour of BIO_get_num_renegotiates() and BIO_ctrl()
   for BIO_C_GET_WRITE_BUF_SIZE ("Stephen Hinton" &lt;shinton@netopia.com&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rework the configuration and shared library support for Tru64 Unix.
   The configuration part makes use of modern compiler features and
   still retains old compiler behavior for those that run older versions
   of the OS.  The shared library support part includes a variant that
   uses the RPATH feature, and is available through the special
   configuration target "alpha-cc-rpath", which will never be selected
   automatically.

   *Tim Mooney &lt;mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * In ssl3_get_key_exchange (ssl/s3_clnt.c), call ssl3_get_message()
   with the same message size as in ssl3_get_certificate_request().
   Otherwise, if no ServerKeyExchange message occurs, CertificateRequest
   messages might inadvertently be reject as too long.

   *Petr Lampa &lt;lampa@fee.vutbr.cz&gt;*

 * Enhanced support for IA-64 Unix platforms (well, Linux and HP-UX).

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

 * Modified SSL library such that the verify_callback that has been set
   specifically for an SSL object with SSL_set_verify() is actually being
   used. Before the change, a verify_callback set with this function was
   ignored and the verify_callback() set in the SSL_CTX at the time of
   the call was used. New function X509_STORE_CTX_set_verify_cb() introduced
   to allow the necessary settings.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initialize static variable in crypto/dsa/dsa_lib.c and crypto/dh/dh_lib.c
   explicitly to NULL, as at least on Solaris 8 this seems not always to be
   done automatically (in contradiction to the requirements of the C
   standard). This made problems when used from OpenSSH.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * In OpenSSL 0.9.6a and 0.9.6b, crypto/dh/dh_key.c ignored
   dh-&gt;length and always used
@iverbatim 
    BN_rand_range(priv_key, dh-&gt;p).
@endiverbatim
   BN_rand_range() is not necessary for Diffie-Hellman, and this
   specific range makes Diffie-Hellman unnecessarily inefficient if
   dh-&gt;length (recommended exponent length) is much smaller than the
   length of dh-&gt;p.  We could use BN_rand_range() if the order of
   the subgroup was stored in the DH structure, but we only have
   dh-&gt;length.

   So switch back to
@iverbatim 
    BN_rand(priv_key, l, ...)
@endiverbatim
   where 'l' is dh-&gt;length if this is defined, or BN_num_bits(dh-&gt;p)-1
   otherwise.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In
@iverbatim 
    RSA_eay_public_encrypt
    RSA_eay_private_decrypt
    RSA_eay_private_encrypt (signing)
    RSA_eay_public_decrypt (signature verification)
@endiverbatim
   (default implementations for RSA_public_encrypt,
   RSA_private_decrypt, RSA_private_encrypt, RSA_public_decrypt),
   always reject numbers &gt;= n.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In crypto/rand/md_rand.c, use a new short-time lock CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2
   to synchronize access to 'locking_thread'.  This is necessary on
   systems where access to 'locking_thread' (an 'unsigned long'
   variable) is not atomic.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In crypto/rand/md_rand.c, set 'locking_thread' to current thread's ID
   &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; setting the 'crypto_lock_rand' flag.  The previous code had
   a race condition if 0 is a valid thread ID.

   *Travis Vitek &lt;vitek@roguewave.com&gt;*

 * Add support for shared libraries under Irix.

   *Albert Chin-A-Young &lt;china@thewrittenword.com&gt;*

 * Add configuration option to build on Linux on both big-endian and
   little-endian MIPS.

   *Ralf Baechle &lt;ralf@uni-koblenz.de&gt;*

 * Add the possibility to create shared libraries on HP-UX.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md160 Changes between 0.9.6a and 0.9.6b  [9 Jul 2001]

 * Change ssleay_rand_bytes (crypto/rand/md_rand.c)
   to avoid a SSLeay/OpenSSL PRNG weakness pointed out by
   Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen &lt;markku-juhani.saarinen@nokia.com&gt;:
   PRNG state recovery was possible based on the output of
   one PRNG request appropriately sized to gain knowledge on
   'md' followed by enough consecutive 1-byte PRNG requests
   to traverse all of 'state'.

   1. When updating 'md_local' (the current thread's copy of 'md')
      during PRNG output generation, hash all of the previous
      'md_local' value, not just the half used for PRNG output.

   2. Make the number of bytes from 'state' included into the hash
      independent from the number of PRNG bytes requested.

   The first measure alone would be sufficient to avoid
   Markku-Juhani's attack.  (Actually it had never occurred
   to me that the half of 'md_local' used for chaining was the
   half from which PRNG output bytes were taken &amp;ndash; I had always
   assumed that the secret half would be used.)  The second
   measure makes sure that additional data from 'state' is never
   mixed into 'md_local' in small portions; this heuristically
   further strengthens the PRNG.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix crypto/bn/asm/mips3.s.

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

 * When only the key is given to "enc", the IV is undefined. Print out
   an error message in this case.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Handle special case when X509_NAME is empty in X509 printing routines.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In dsa_do_verify (crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c), verify that r and s are
   positive and less than q.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Don't change &lt;tt&gt;*pointer&lt;/tt&gt; in CRYPTO_add_lock() is add_lock_callback is
   used: it isn't thread safe and the add_lock_callback should handle
   that itself.

   *Paul Rose &lt;Paul.Rose@bridge.com&gt;*

 * Verify that incoming data obeys the block size in
   ssl3_enc (ssl/s3_enc.c) and tls1_enc (ssl/t1_enc.c).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix OAEP check.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller, Bodo Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * The countermeasure against Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5
   RSA encryption was accidentally removed in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.5
   when fixing the server behaviour for backwards-compatible 'client
   hello' messages.  (Note that the attack is impractical against
   SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 anyway because length and version checking
   means that the probability of guessing a valid ciphertext is
   around 2^-40; see section 5 in Bleichenbacher's CRYPTO '98
   paper.)

   Before 0.9.5, the countermeasure (hide the error by generating a
   random 'decryption result') did not work properly because
   ERR_clear_error() was missing, meaning that SSL_get_error() would
   detect the supposedly ignored error.

   Both problems are now fixed.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In crypto/bio/bf_buff.c, increase DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE to 4096
   (previously it was 1024).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for compatibility mode trust settings: ignore trust settings
   unless some valid trust or reject settings are present.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for blowfish EVP: its a variable length cipher.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix various bugs related to DSA S/MIME verification. Handle missing
   parameters in DSA public key structures and return an error in the
   DSA routines if parameters are absent.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * In versions up to 0.9.6, RAND_file_name() resorted to file ".rnd"
   in the current directory if neither $RANDFILE nor $HOME was set.
   RAND_file_name() in 0.9.6a returned NULL in this case.  This has
   caused some confusion to Windows users who haven't defined $HOME.
   Thus RAND_file_name() is changed again: e_os.h can define a
   DEFAULT_HOME, which will be used if $HOME is not set.
   For Windows, we use "C:"; on other platforms, we still require
   environment variables.

 * Move 'if (!initialized) RAND_poll()' into regions protected by
   CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND.  This is not strictly necessary, but avoids
   having multiple threads call RAND_poll() concurrently.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In crypto/rand/md_rand.c, replace 'add_do_not_lock' flag by a
   combination of a flag and a thread ID variable.
   Otherwise while one thread is in ssleay_rand_bytes (which sets the
   flag), &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; threads can enter ssleay_add_bytes without obeying
   the CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND lock (and may even illegally release the lock
   that they do not hold after the first thread unsets add_do_not_lock).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change bctest again: '-x' expressions are not available in all
   versions of 'test'.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md161 Changes between 0.9.6 and 0.9.6a  [5 Apr 2001]

 * Fix a couple of memory leaks in PKCS7_dataDecode()

   *Steve Henson, reported by Heyun Zheng &lt;hzheng@atdsprint.com&gt;*

 * Change Configure and Makefiles to provide EXE_EXT, which will contain
   the default extension for executables, if any.  Also, make the perl
   scripts that use symlink() to test if it really exists and use "cp"
   if it doesn't.  All this made OpenSSL compilable and installable in
   CygWin.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for asn1_GetSequence() for indefinite length constructed data.
   If SEQUENCE is length is indefinite just set c-&gt;slen to the total
   amount of data available.

   *Steve Henson, reported by shige@FreeBSD.org*

   &lt;em&gt;This change does not apply to 0.9.7.&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change bctest to avoid here-documents inside command substitution
   (workaround for FreeBSD /bin/sh bug).
   For compatibility with Ultrix, avoid shell functions (introduced
   in the bctest version that searches along $PATH).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Rename 'des_encrypt' to 'des_encrypt1'.  This avoids the clashes
   with des_encrypt() defined on some operating systems, like Solaris
   and UnixWare.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Check the result of RSA-CRT (see D. Boneh, R. DeMillo, R. Lipton:
   On the Importance of Eliminating Errors in Cryptographic
   Computations, J. Cryptology 14 (2001) 2, 101-119,
   &lt;http://theory.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/faults.ps.gz&gt;).

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * MIPS assembler BIGNUM division bug fix.

   &lt;em&gt;Andy Polyakov&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disabled incorrect Alpha assembler code.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix PKCS#7 decode routines so they correctly update the length
   after reading an EOC for the EXPLICIT tag.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

   &lt;em&gt;This change does not apply to 0.9.7.&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix bug in PKCS#12 key generation routines. This was triggered
   if a 3DES key was generated with a 0 initial byte. Include
   PKCS12_BROKEN_KEYGEN compilation option to retain the old
   (but broken) behaviour.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Enhance bctest to search for a working bc along $PATH and print
   it when found.

   *Tim Rice &lt;tim@multitalents.net&gt; via Richard Levitte*

 * Fix memory leaks in err.c: free err_data string if necessary;
   don't write to the wrong index in ERR_set_error_data.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Implement ssl23_peek (analogous to ssl23_read), which previously
   did not exist.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Replace rdtsc with &lt;tt&gt;_emit&lt;/tt&gt; statements for VC++ version 5.

   *Jeremy Cooper &lt;jeremy@baymoo.org&gt;*

 * Make it possible to reuse SSLv2 sessions.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * In copy_email() check for &gt;= 0 as a return value for
   X509_NAME_get_index_by_NID() since 0 is a valid index.

   *Steve Henson reported by Massimiliano Pala &lt;madwolf@opensca.org&gt;*

 * Avoid coredump with unsupported or invalid public keys by checking if
   X509_get_pubkey() fails in PKCS7_verify(). Fix memory leak when
   PKCS7_verify() fails with non detached data.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Don't use getenv in library functions when run as setuid/setgid.
   New function OPENSSL_issetugid().

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid false positives in memory leak detection code (crypto/mem_dbg.c)
   due to incorrect handling of multi-threading:

   1. Fix timing glitch in the MemCheck_off() portion of CRYPTO_mem_ctrl().

   2. Fix logical glitch in is_MemCheck_on() aka CRYPTO_is_mem_check_on().

   3. Count how many times MemCheck_off() has been called so that
      nested use can be treated correctly.  This also avoids
      inband-signalling in the previous code (which relied on the
      assumption that thread ID 0 is impossible).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add "-rand" option also to s_client and s_server.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix CPU detection on Irix 6.x.
   *Kurt Hockenbury &lt;khockenb@stevens-tech.edu&gt; and
   "Bruce W. Forsberg" &lt;bruce.forsberg@baesystems.com&gt;*

 * Fix X509_NAME bug which produced incorrect encoding if X509_NAME
   was empty.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

   &lt;em&gt;This change does not apply to 0.9.7.&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use the cached encoding of an X509_NAME structure rather than
   copying it. This is apparently the reason for the libsafe "errors"
   but the code is actually correct.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add new function BN_rand_range(), and fix DSA_sign_setup() to prevent
   Bleichenbacher's DSA attack.
   Extend BN_[pseudo_]rand: As before, top=1 forces the highest two bits
   to be set and top=0 forces the highest bit to be set; top=-1 is new
   and leaves the highest bit random.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller, Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * In the &lt;tt&gt;NCONF_...&lt;/tt&gt;-based implementations for &lt;tt&gt;CONF_...&lt;/tt&gt; queries
   (crypto/conf/conf_lib.c), if the input LHASH is NULL, avoid using
   a temporary CONF structure with the data component set to NULL
   (which gives segmentation faults in lh_retrieve).
   Instead, use NULL for the CONF pointer in CONF_get_string and
   CONF_get_number (which may use environment variables) and directly
   return NULL from CONF_get_section.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix potential buffer overrun for EBCDIC.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Tolerate nonRepudiation as being valid for S/MIME signing and certSign
   keyUsage if basicConstraints absent for a CA.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make SMIME_write_PKCS7() write mail header values with a format that
   is more generally accepted (no spaces before the semicolon), since
   some programs can't parse those values properly otherwise.  Also make
   sure BIO's that break lines after each write do not create invalid
   headers.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make the CRL encoding routines work with empty SEQUENCE OF. The
   macros previously used would not encode an empty SEQUENCE OF
   and break the signature.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

   &lt;em&gt;This change does not apply to 0.9.7.&lt;/em&gt;

 * Zero the premaster secret after deriving the master secret in
   DH ciphersuites.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add some EVP_add_digest_alias registrations (as found in
   OpenSSL_add_all_digests()) to SSL_library_init()
   aka OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms().  This provides improved
   compatibility with peers using X.509 certificates
   with unconventional AlgorithmIdentifier OIDs.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for Irix with NO_ASM.

   *"Bruce W. Forsberg" &lt;bruce.forsberg@baesystems.com&gt;*

 * ./config script fixes.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Moeller, Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix 'openssl passwd -1'.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Change PKCS12_key_gen_asc() so it can cope with non null
   terminated strings whose length is passed in the passlen
   parameter, for example from PEM callbacks. This was done
   by adding an extra length parameter to asc2uni().

   *Steve Henson, reported by &lt;oddissey@samsung.co.kr&gt;*

 * Fix C code generated by 'openssl dsaparam -C': If a BN_bin2bn
   call failed, free the DSA structure.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix to uni2asc() to cope with zero length Unicode strings.
   These are present in some PKCS#12 files.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Increase s2-&gt;wbuf allocation by one byte in ssl2_new (ssl/s2_lib.c).
   Otherwise do_ssl_write (ssl/s2_pkt.c) will write beyond buffer limits
   when writing a 32767 byte record.

   *Bodo Moeller; problem reported by Eric Day &lt;eday@concentric.net&gt;*

 * In &lt;tt&gt;RSA_eay_public_{en,ed}crypt&lt;/tt&gt; and RSA_eay_mod_exp (rsa_eay.c),
   obtain lock CRYPTO_LOCK_RSA before setting &lt;tt&gt;rsa-\&gt;_method_mod_{n,p,q}&lt;/tt&gt;.

   (RSA objects have a reference count access to which is protected
   by CRYPTO_LOCK_RSA [see rsa_lib.c, s3_srvr.c, ssl_cert.c, ssl_rsa.c],
   so they are meant to be shared between threads.)
   *Bodo Moeller, Geoff Thorpe; original patch submitted by
   "Reddie, Steven" &lt;Steven.Reddie@ca.com&gt;*

 * Fix a deadlock in CRYPTO_mem_leaks().

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Use better test patterns in bntest.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * rand_win.c fix for Borland C.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * BN_rshift bugfix for n == 0.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a 'bctest' script that checks for some known 'bc' bugs
   so that 'make test' does not abort just because 'bc' is broken.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Store verify_result within SSL_SESSION also for client side to
   avoid potential security hole. (Re-used sessions on the client side
   always resulted in verify_result==X509_V_OK, not using the original
   result of the server certificate verification.)

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix ssl3_pending: If the record in s-&gt;s3-&gt;rrec is not of type
   SSL3_RT_APPLICATION_DATA, return 0.
   Similarly, change ssl2_pending to return 0 if SSL_in_init(s) is true.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix SSL_peek:
   Both ssl2_peek and ssl3_peek, which were totally broken in earlier
   releases, have been re-implemented by renaming the previous
   implementations of ssl2_read and ssl3_read to ssl2_read_internal
   and ssl3_read_internal, respectively, and adding 'peek' parameters
   to them.  The new ssl[23]_{read,peek} functions are calls to
   ssl[23]_read_internal with the 'peek' flag set appropriately.
   A 'peek' parameter has also been added to ssl3_read_bytes, which
   does the actual work for ssl3_read_internal.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Initialise "ex_data" member of RSA/DSA/DH structures prior to calling
   the method-specific "init()" handler. Also clean up ex_data after
   calling the method-specific "finish()" handler. Previously, this was
   happening the other way round.

   &lt;em&gt;Geoff Thorpe&lt;/em&gt;

 * Increase BN_CTX_NUM (the number of BIGNUMs in a BN_CTX) to 16.
   The previous value, 12, was not always sufficient for BN_mod_exp().

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Make sure that shared libraries get the internal name engine with
   the full version number and not just 0.  This should mark the
   shared libraries as not backward compatible.  Of course, this should
   be changed again when we can guarantee backward binary compatibility.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix typo in get_cert_by_subject() in by_dir.c

   *Jean-Marc Desperrier &lt;jean-marc.desperrier@certplus.com&gt;*

 * Rework the system to generate shared libraries:

   - Make note of the expected extension for the shared libraries and
     if there is a need for symbolic links from for example libcrypto.so.0
     to libcrypto.so.0.9.7.  There is extended info in Configure for
     that.

   - Make as few rebuilds of the shared libraries as possible.

   - Still avoid linking the OpenSSL programs with the shared libraries.

   - When installing, install the shared libraries separately from the
     static ones.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead macro to actually use its argument.

   Copy SSL_CTX's read_ahead flag to SSL object directly in SSL_new
   and not in SSL_clear because the latter is also used by the
   accept/connect functions; previously, the settings made by
   SSL_set_read_ahead would be lost during the handshake.

   *Bodo Moeller; problems reported by Anders Gertz &lt;gertz@epact.se&gt;*

 * Correct util/mkdef.pl to be selective about disabled algorithms.
   Previously, it would create entries for disabled algorithms no
   matter what.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added several new manual pages for SSL_* function.

   &lt;em&gt;Lutz Jaenicke&lt;/em&gt;

@subsection autotoc_md162 Changes between 0.9.5a and 0.9.6  [24 Sep 2000]

 * In ssl23_get_client_hello, generate an error message when faced
   with an initial SSL 3.0/TLS record that is too small to contain the
   first two bytes of the ClientHello message, i.e. client_version.
   (Note that this is a pathologic case that probably has never happened
   in real life.)  The previous approach was to use the version number
   from the record header as a substitute; but our protocol choice
   should not depend on that one because it is not authenticated
   by the Finished messages.

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * More robust randomness gathering functions for Windows.

   *Jeffrey Altman &lt;jaltman@columbia.edu&gt;*

 * For compatibility reasons if the flag X509_V_FLAG_ISSUER_CHECK is
   not set then we don't setup the error code for issuer check errors
   to avoid possibly overwriting other errors which the callback does
   handle. If an application does set the flag then we assume it knows
   what it is doing and can handle the new informational codes
   appropriately.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix for a nasty bug in ASN1_TYPE handling. ASN1_TYPE is used for
   a general "ANY" type, as such it should be able to decode anything
   including tagged types. However it didn't check the class so it would
   wrongly interpret tagged types in the same way as their universal
   counterpart and unknown types were just rejected. Changed so that the
   tagged and unknown types are handled in the same way as a SEQUENCE:
   that is the encoding is stored intact. There is also a new type
   "V_ASN1_OTHER" which is used when the class is not universal, in this
   case we have no idea what the actual type is so we just lump them all
   together.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * On VMS, stdout may very well lead to a file that is written to
   in a record-oriented fashion.  That means that every write() will
   write a separate record, which will be read separately by the
   programs trying to read from it.  This can be very confusing.

   The solution is to put a BIO filter in the way that will buffer
   text until a linefeed is reached, and then write everything a
   line at a time, so every record written will be an actual line,
   not chunks of lines and not (usually doesn't happen, but I've
   seen it once) several lines in one record.  BIO_f_linebuffer() is
   the answer.

   Currently, it's a VMS-only method, because that's where it has
   been tested well enough.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Remove 'optimized' squaring variant in BN_mod_mul_montgomery,
   it can return incorrect results.
   (Note: The buggy variant was not enabled in OpenSSL 0.9.5a,
   but it was in 0.9.6-beta[12].)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Disable the check for content being present when verifying detached
   signatures in pk7_smime.c. Some versions of Netscape (wrongly)
   include zero length content when signing messages.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New BIO_shutdown_wr macro, which invokes the BIO_C_SHUTDOWN_WR
   BIO_ctrl (for BIO pairs).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add DSO method for VMS.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Bug fix: Montgomery multiplication could produce results with the
   wrong sign.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add RPM specification openssl.spec and modify it to build three
   packages.  The default package contains applications, application
   documentation and run-time libraries.  The devel package contains
   include files, static libraries and function documentation.  The
   doc package contains the contents of the doc directory.  The original
   openssl.spec was provided by Damien Miller &lt;djm@mindrot.org&gt;.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a large number of documentation files for many SSL routines.

   *Lutz Jaenicke &lt;Lutz.Jaenicke@aet.TU-Cottbus.DE&gt;*

 * Add a configuration entry for Sony News 4.

   *NAKAJI Hiroyuki &lt;nakaji@tutrp.tut.ac.jp&gt;*

 * Don't set the two most significant bits to one when generating a
   random number &lt; q in the DSA library.

   &lt;em&gt;Ulf Möller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New SSL API mode 'SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY'.  This disables the default
   behaviour that SSL_read may result in SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ (even if
   the underlying transport is blocking) if a handshake took place.
   (The default behaviour is needed by applications such as s_client
   and s_server that use select() to determine when to use SSL_read;
   but for applications that know in advance when to expect data, it
   just makes things more complicated.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add RAND_egd_bytes(), which gives control over the number of bytes read
   from EGD.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add a few more EBCDIC conditionals that make &lt;tt&gt;req&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;x509&lt;/tt&gt;
   work better on such systems.

   *Martin Kraemer &lt;Martin.Kraemer@MchP.Siemens.De&gt;*

 * Add two demo programs for PKCS12_parse() and PKCS12_create().
   Update PKCS12_parse() so it copies the friendlyName and the
   keyid to the certificates aux info.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix bug in PKCS7_verify() which caused an infinite loop
   if there was more than one signature.

   *Sven Uszpelkat &lt;su@celocom.de&gt;*

 * Major change in util/mkdef.pl to include extra information
   about each symbol, as well as presenting variables as well
   as functions.  This change means that there's n more need
   to rebuild the .num files when some algorithms are excluded.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Allow the verify time to be set by an application,
   rather than always using the current time.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Phase 2 verify code reorganisation. The certificate
   verify code now looks up an issuer certificate by a
   number of criteria: subject name, authority key id
   and key usage. It also verifies self signed certificates
   by the same criteria. The main comparison function is
   X509_check_issued() which performs these checks.

   Lot of changes were necessary in order to support this
   without completely rewriting the lookup code.

   Authority and subject key identifier are now cached.

   The LHASH 'certs' is X509_STORE has now been replaced
   by a STACK_OF(X509_OBJECT). This is mainly because an
   LHASH can't store or retrieve multiple objects with
   the same hash value.

   As a result various functions (which were all internal
   use only) have changed to handle the new X509_STORE
   structure. This will break anything that messed round
   with X509_STORE internally.

   The functions X509_STORE_add_cert() now checks for an
   exact match, rather than just subject name.

   The X509_STORE API doesn't directly support the retrieval
   of multiple certificates matching a given criteria, however
   this can be worked round by performing a lookup first
   (which will fill the cache with candidate certificates)
   and then examining the cache for matches. This is probably
   the best we can do without throwing out X509_LOOKUP
   entirely (maybe later...).

   The X509_VERIFY_CTX structure has been enhanced considerably.

   All certificate lookup operations now go via a get_issuer()
   callback. Although this currently uses an X509_STORE it
   can be replaced by custom lookups. This is a simple way
   to bypass the X509_STORE hackery necessary to make this
   work and makes it possible to use more efficient techniques
   in future. A very simple version which uses a simple
   STACK for its trusted certificate store is also provided
   using X509_STORE_CTX_trusted_stack().

   The verify_cb() and verify() callbacks now have equivalents
   in the X509_STORE_CTX structure.

   X509_STORE_CTX also has a 'flags' field which can be used
   to customise the verify behaviour.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Add new PKCS#7 signing option PKCS7_NOSMIMECAP which
   excludes S/MIME capabilities.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * When a certificate request is read in keep a copy of the
   original encoding of the signed data and use it when outputting
   again. Signatures then use the original encoding rather than
   a decoded, encoded version which may cause problems if the
   request is improperly encoded.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * For consistency with other BIO_puts implementations, call
   buffer_write(b, ...) directly in buffer_puts instead of calling
   BIO_write(b, ...).

   In BIO_puts, increment b-&gt;num_write as in BIO_write.

   *Peter.Sylvester@EdelWeb.fr*

 * Fix BN_mul_word for the case where the word is 0. (We have to use
   BN_zero, we may not return a BIGNUM with an array consisting of
   words set to zero.)

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * Avoid calling abort() from within the library when problems are
   detected, except if preprocessor symbols have been defined
   (such as REF_CHECK, BN_DEBUG etc.).

   &lt;em&gt;Bodo Moeller&lt;/em&gt;

 * New openssl application 'rsautl'. This utility can be
   used for low-level RSA operations. DER public key
   BIO/fp routines also added.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * New Configure entry and patches for compiling on QNX 4.

   *Andreas Schneider &lt;andreas@ds3.etech.fh-hamburg.de&gt;*

 * A demo state-machine implementation was sponsored by
   Nuron (&lt;http://www.nuron.com/&gt;) and is now available in
   demos/state_machine.

   &lt;em&gt;Ben Laurie&lt;/em&gt;

 * New options added to the 'dgst' utility for signature
   generation and verification.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Unrecognized PKCS#7 content types are now handled via a
   catch all ASN1_TYPE structure. This allows unsupported
   types to be stored as a "blob" and an application can
   encode and decode it manually.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Fix various signed/unsigned issues to make a_strex.c
   compile under VC++.

   *Oscar Jacobsson &lt;oscar.jacobsson@celocom.com&gt;*

 * ASN1 fixes. i2d_ASN1_OBJECT was not returning the correct
   length if passed a buffer. ASN1_INTEGER_to_BN failed
   if passed a NULL BN and its argument was negative.

   *Steve Henson, pointed out by Sven Heiberg &lt;sven@tartu.cyber.ee&gt;*

 * Modification to PKCS#7 encoding routines to output definite
   length encoding. Since currently the whole structures are in
   memory there's not real point in using indefinite length
   constructed encoding. However if OpenSSL is compiled with
   the flag PKCS7_INDEFINITE_ENCODING the old form is used.

   &lt;em&gt;Steve Henson&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added BIO_vprintf() and BIO_vsnprintf().

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Added more prefixes to parse for in the strings written
   through a logging bio, to cover all the levels that are available
   through syslog.  The prefixes are now:
@iverbatim 
    PANIC, EMERG, EMR       =&gt;      LOG_EMERG
    ALERT, ALR              =&gt;      LOG_ALERT
    CRIT, CRI               =&gt;      LOG_CRIT
    ERROR, ERR              =&gt;      LOG_ERR
    WARNING, WARN, WAR      =&gt;      LOG_WARNING
    NOTICE, NOTE, NOT       =&gt;      LOG_NOTICE
    INFO, INF               =&gt;      LOG_INFO
    DEBUG, DBG              =&gt;      LOG_DEBUG
@endiverbatim
   and as before, if none of those prefixes are present at the
   beginning of the string, LOG_ERR is chosen.

   On Win32, the &lt;tt&gt;LOG_*&lt;/tt&gt; levels are mapped according to this:
@iverbatim 
    LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR =&gt; EVENTLOG_ERROR_TYPE
    LOG_WARNING                             =&gt; EVENTLOG_WARNING_TYPE
    LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG         =&gt; EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE
@endiverbatim
   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * Made it possible to reconfigure with just the configuration
   argument "reconf" or "reconfigure".  The command line arguments
   are stored in Makefile.ssl in the variable CONFIGURE_ARGS,
   and are retrieved from there when reconfiguring.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * MD4 implemented.

   *Assar Westerlund &lt;assar@sics.se&gt;, Richard Levitte*

 * Add the arguments -CAfile and -CApath to the pkcs12 utility.

   &lt;em&gt;Richard Levitte&lt;/em&gt;

 * The obj_dat.pl script was messing up the sorting of object
   names. The reason was that it compared the quoted version
   of strings as a result "OCSP" &gt; "OCSP Signing" because
   " &gt; SPACE. Changed script to store unquoted versions of names and add quotes on output. It was also omitting some names from the lookup table if they were given a default value (that is if SN is missing it is given the same value as LN and vice versa), these are now added on the grounds that if an object has a name we should be able to look it up. Finally added warning output when duplicate short or long names are found.</p>

As entropy may not be well distributed from the beginning, 'md' is important as a chaining variable. However, the output function chains only half of 'md', i.e. 80 bits. ssleay_rand_add, on the other hand, chains all of 'md', and seeding with STATE_SIZE dummy bytes will result in all of 'state' being rewritten, with the new values depending on virtually all of 'md'.

<li><p class="startli">RSA_get_default_method() will now cause a default RSA_METHOD to be chosen if one doesn't exist already. Previously this was only set during a call to RSA_new() or RSA_new_method(NULL) meaning it was possible for RSA_get_default_method() to return NULL.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Added native name translation to the existing DSO code that will convert (if the flag to do so is set) filenames that are sufficiently small and have no path information into a canonical native form. Eg. "blah" converted to "libblah.so" or "blah.dll" etc.</p>

<li><p class="startli">CONF library reworked to become more general. A new CONF configuration file reader "class" is implemented as well as a new functions (<code>NCONF_*</code>, for "New CONF") to handle it. The now old <code>CONF_*</code> functions are still there, but are reimplemented to work in terms of the new functions. Also, a set of functions to handle the internal storage of the configuration data is provided to make it easier to write new configuration file reader "classes" (I can definitely see something reading a configuration file in XML format, for example), called <code>_CONF_*</code>, or "the configuration storage API"...</p>
<p class="startli">The new configuration file reading functions are: </p><pre class="fragment">    NCONF_new, NCONF_free, NCONF_load, NCONF_load_fp, NCONF_load_bio,
    NCONF_get_section, NCONF_get_string, NCONF_get_numbre

    NCONF_default, NCONF_WIN32

    NCONF_dump_fp, NCONF_dump_bio
</pre><p> NCONF_default and NCONF_WIN32 are method (or "class") choosers, NCONF_new creates a new CONF object. This works in the same way as other interfaces in OpenSSL, like the BIO interface. <code>NCONF_dump_*</code> dump the internal storage of the configuration file, which is useful for debugging. All other functions take the same arguments as the old <code>CONF_*</code> functions with the exception of the first that must be a <code>CONF *</code> instead of a <code>LHASH *</code>.</p>
<p class="startli">To make it easier to use the new classes with the old <code>CONF_*</code> functions, the function CONF_set_default_method is provided.</p>

Changes between 0.9.5 and 0.9.5a [1 Apr 2000]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure _lrotl and _lrotr are only used with MSVC.</li>
<li>Use lock CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND correctly in ssleay_rand_status (the default implementation of RAND_status).</li>
<li>Rename openssl x509 option '-crlext', which was added in 0.9.5, to '-clrext' (= clear extensions), as intended and documented. *Bodo Moeller; inconsistency pointed out by Michael Attili <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'att'+'il'+'i@a'+'ma'+'xo.'+'co'+'m'; return false;">attil<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>i@am<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>axo.c<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>om</a>*</li>

<li><p class="startli">Modernise PKCS12_parse() so it uses STACK_OF(X509) for its ca argument fix a leak when the ca argument was passed as NULL. Stop X509_PUBKEY_set() using the passed key: if the passed key was a private key the result of X509_print(), for example, would be to print out all the private key components.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li>des_quad_cksum() byte order bug fix. *Ulf Möller, using the problem description in krb4-0.9.7, where the solution is attributed to Derrick J Brashear <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'sha'+'do'+'w@D'+'EM'+'ENT'+'IA'+'.OR'+'G'; return false;">shado<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>w@DE<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>MENTI<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>A.OR<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>G</a>*</li>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">For easily testing in shell scripts whether some command 'openssl XXX' exists, the new pseudo-command 'openssl no-XXX' returns with exit code 0 iff no command of the given name is available. 'no-XXX' is printed in this case, 'XXX' otherwise. In both cases, the output goes to stdout and nothing is printed to stderr. Additional arguments are always ignored.</p>
<p class="startli">Since for each cipher there is a command of the same name, the 'no-cipher' compilation switches can be tested this way.</p>
<p class="startli">('openssl no-XXX' is not able to detect pseudo-commands such as 'quit', 'list-XXX-commands', or 'no-XXX' itself.)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Update test suite so that 'make test' succeeds in 'no-rsa' configuration.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">For SSL_[CTX_]set_tmp_dh, don't create a DH key if SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set; it will be thrown away anyway because each handshake creates its own key. ssl_cert_dup, which is used by SSL_new, now copies DH keys in addition to parameters &ndash; in previous versions (since OpenSSL 0.9.3) the 'default key' from SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh would always be lost, meaning you effectively got SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE when using this macro.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New s_client option -ign_eof: EOF at stdin is ignored, and 'Q' and 'R' lose their special meanings (quit/renegotiate). This is part of what -quiet does; unlike -quiet, -ign_eof does not suppress any output.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add compatibility options to the purpose and trust code. The purpose X509_PURPOSE_ANY is "any purpose" which automatically accepts a certificate or CA, this was the previous behaviour, with all the associated security issues.</p>
<p class="startli">X509_TRUST_COMPAT is the old trust behaviour: only and automatically trust self signed roots in certificate store. A new trust setting X509_TRUST_DEFAULT is used to specify that a purpose has no associated trust setting and it should instead use the value in the default purpose.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fix the PKCS#8 DSA private key code so it decodes keys again and fix a memory leak.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">In util/mkerr.pl (which implements 'make errors'), preserve reason strings from the previous version of the .c file, as the default to have only downcase letters (and digits) in automatically generated reasons codes is not always appropriate.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">In ERR_load_ERR_strings(), build an ERR_LIB_SYS error reason table using strerror. Previously, ERR_reason_error_string() returned library names as reason strings for SYSerr; but SYSerr is a special case where small numbers are errno values, not library numbers.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add '-dsaparam' option to 'openssl dhparam' application. This converts DSA parameters into DH parameters. (When creating parameters, DSA_generate_parameters is used.)</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Include 'length' (recommended exponent length) in C code generated by 'openssl dhparam -C'.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The second argument to set_label in perlasm was already being used so couldn't be used as a "file scope" flag. Moved to third argument which was free.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">In PEM_ASN1_write_bio and some other functions, use RAND_pseudo_bytes instead of RAND_bytes for encryption IVs and salts.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Include RAND_status() into RAND_METHOD instead of implementing it only for md_rand.c Otherwise replacing the PRNG by calling RAND_set_rand_method would be impossible.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Don't let DSA_generate_key() enter an infinite loop if the random number generation fails.</p>

<li><p class="startli">BN_mul bugfix: In bn_mul_part_recursion() only the a&gt;a[n] &amp;&amp; b&gt;b[n] case was implemented. This caused BN_div_recp() to fail occasionally.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add an optional second argument to the set_label() in the perl assembly language builder. If this argument exists and is set to 1 it signals that the assembler should use a symbol whose scope is the entire file, not just the current function. This is needed with MASM which uses the format label:: for this scope.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the ASN1 types so they are typedefs by default. Before almost all types were define'd to ASN1_STRING which was causing STACK_OF() problems: you couldn't declare STACK_OF(ASN1_UTF8STRING) for example.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change names of new functions to the new get1/get0 naming convention: After 'get1', the caller owns a reference count and has to call <code>..._free</code>; 'get0' returns a pointer to some data structure without incrementing reference counters. (Some of the existing 'get' functions increment a reference counter, some don't.) Similarly, 'set1' and 'add1' functions increase reference counters or duplicate objects.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Support EGD <a href="http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/">http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/</a>. New functions RAND_egd() and RAND_status(). In the command line application, the EGD socket can be specified like a seed file using RANDFILE or -rand.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Allow the string CERTIFICATE to be tolerated in PKCS#7 structures. Some CAs (e.g. Verisign) distribute certificates in this form.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Remove the SSL_ALLOW_ADH compile option and set the default cipher list to exclude them. This means that no special compilation option is needed to use anonymous DH: it just needs to be included in the cipher list.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the EVP_MD_CTX_type macro so its meaning consistent with EVP_MD_type. The old functionality is available in a new macro called EVP_MD_md(). Change code that uses it and update docs.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>..._ctrl</code> functions now have corresponding <code>..._callback_ctrl</code> functions where the <code>void *</code> argument is replaced by a function pointer argument. Previously <code>void *</code> was abused to point to functions, which works on many platforms, but is not correct. As these functions are usually called by macros defined in OpenSSL header files, most source code should work without changes.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>&lt;<a class="el" href="opensslconf_8h_source.html">openssl/opensslconf.h</a>&gt;</code> (which is created by Configure) now contains sections with information on -D... compiler switches used for compiling the library so that applications can see them. To enable one of these sections, a pre-processor symbol <code>OPENSSL_..._DEFINES</code> must be defined. E.g., define OPENSSL_ALGORITHM_DEFINES include &lt;<a class="el" href="opensslconf_8h_source.html">openssl/opensslconf.h</a>&gt; defines all pertinent <code>NO_&lt;algo&gt;</code> symbols, such as NO_IDEA, NO_RSA, etc.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Richard Levitte, Ulf and Bodo Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Bugfix: Tolerate fragmentation and interleaving in the SSL 3/TLS record layer.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the 'other' type in certificate aux info to a STACK_OF X509_ALGOR. Although not an AlgorithmIdentifier as such it has the required ASN1 format: arbitrary types determined by an OID.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add some PEM_write_X509_REQ_NEW() functions and a command line argument to 'req'. This is not because the function is newer or better than others it just uses the work 'NEW' in the certificate request header lines. Some software needs this.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Reorganise password command line arguments: now passwords can be obtained from various sources. Delete the PEM_cb function and make it the default behaviour: i.e. if the callback is NULL and the usrdata argument is not NULL interpret it as a null terminated pass phrase. If usrdata and the callback are NULL then the pass phrase is prompted for as usual.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for the Compaq Atalla crypto accelerator. If it is installed, the support is automatically enabled. The resulting binaries will autodetect the card and use it if present.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ben Laurie and Compaq Inc.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Work around for Netscape hang bug. This sends certificate request and server done in one record. Since this is perfectly legal in the SSL/TLS protocol it isn't a "bug" option and is on by default. See the bugs/SSLv3 entry for more info.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the <code>SSLeay_add_all_*()</code> functions to <code>OpenSSL_add_all_*()</code> and include a define from the old name to the new. The original intent was that statically linked binaries could for example just call SSLeay_add_all_ciphers() to just add ciphers to the table and not link with digests. This never worked because SSLeay_add_all_digests() and SSLeay_add_all_ciphers() were in the same source file so calling one would link with the other. They are now in separate source files.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Source code cleanups: use const where appropriate, eliminate casts, use <code>void *</code> instead of <code>char *</code> in lhash.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Bugfix: ssl3_send_server_key_exchange was not restartable (the state was not changed to SSL3_ST_SW_KEY_EXCH_B, and because of this the server could overwrite ephemeral keys that the client has already seen).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Turn DSA_is_prime into a macro that calls BN_is_prime, using 50 iterations of the Rabin-Miller test.</p>
<p class="startli">DSA_generate_parameters now uses BN_is_prime_fasttest (with 50 iterations of the Rabin-Miller test as required by the appendix to FIPS PUB 186[-1]) instead of DSA_is_prime. As BN_is_prime_fasttest includes trial division, DSA parameter generation becomes much faster.</p>
<p class="startli">This implies a change for the callback functions in DSA_is_prime and DSA_generate_parameters: The callback function is called once for each positive witness in the Rabin-Miller test, not just occasionally in the inner loop; and the parameters to the callback function now provide an iteration count for the outer loop rather than for the current invocation of the inner loop. DSA_generate_parameters additionally can call the callback function with an 'iteration count' of -1, meaning that a candidate has passed the trial division test (when q is generated from an application-provided seed, trial division is skipped).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">New function BN_is_prime_fasttest that optionally does trial division before starting the Rabin-Miller test and has an additional BN_CTX * argument (whereas BN_is_prime always has to allocate at least one BN_CTX). 'callback(1, -1, cb_arg)' is called when a number has passed the trial division stage.</p>

<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Avoid a race condition in s2_clnt.c (function get_server_hello) that made it impossible to use the same SSL_SESSION data structure in SSL2 clients in multiple threads.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The return value of RAND_load_file() no longer counts bytes obtained by stat(). RAND_load_file(..., -1) is new and uses the complete file to seed the PRNG (previously an explicit byte count was required).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Ulf Möller, Bodo Möller</em></p>

<li><p class="startli">Changes to X509_ATTRIBUTE utilities. These have been renamed from <code>X509_*()</code> to <code>X509at_*()</code> on the grounds that they don't handle X509 structures and behave in an analogous way to the X509v3 functions: they shouldn't be called directly but wrapper functions should be used instead.</p>
<p class="startli">So we also now have some wrapper functions that call the X509at functions when passed certificate requests. (TO DO: similar things can be done with PKCS#7 signed and unsigned attributes, PKCS#12 attributes and a few other things. Some of these need some d2i or i2d and print functionality because they handle more complex structures.)</p>

<li><p class="startli">Precautions against using the PRNG uninitialized: RAND_bytes() now has a return value which indicates the quality of the random data (1 = ok, 0 = not seeded). Also an error is recorded on the thread's error queue. New function RAND_pseudo_bytes() generates output that is guaranteed to be unique but not unpredictable.

<li><p class="startli">New function X509_CTX_rget_chain() (renamed to X509_CTX_get1_chain in the 0.9.5 release), this returns the chain from an X509_CTX structure with a dup of the stack and all the X509 reference counts upped: so the stack will exist after X509_CTX_cleanup() has been called.

<li><p class="startli">Add PKCS#10 attributes to field table: challengePassword, unstructuredName and unstructuredAddress. These are taken from draft PKCS#9 v2.0 but are compatible with v1.2 provided no international characters are used.</p>
<p class="startli">More changes to X509_ATTRIBUTE code: allow the setting of types based on strings. Remove the 'loc' parameter when adding attributes because these will be a SET OF encoding which is sorted in ASN1 order.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Initial changes to the 'req' utility to allow request generation automation. This will allow an application to just generate a template file containing all the field values and have req construct the request.</p>
<p class="startli">Initial support for X509_ATTRIBUTE handling. Stacks of these are used all over the place including certificate requests and PKCS#7 structures. They are currently handled manually where necessary with some primitive wrappers for PKCS#7. The new functions behave in a manner analogous to the X509 extension functions: they allow attributes to be looked up by NID and added.</p>
<p class="startli">Later something similar to the X509V3 code would be desirable to automatically handle the encoding, decoding and printing of the more complex types. The string types like challengePassword can be handled by the string table functions.</p>
<p class="startli">Also modified the multi byte string table handling. Now there is a 'global mask' which masks out certain types. The table itself can use the flag STABLE_NO_MASK to ignore the mask setting: this is useful when for example there is only one permissible type (as in countryName) and using the mask might result in no valid types at all.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Clean up 'Finished' handling, and add functions SSL_get_finished and SSL_get_peer_finished to allow applications to obtain the latest Finished messages sent to the peer or expected from the peer, respectively. (SSL_get_peer_finished is usually the Finished message actually received from the peer, otherwise the protocol will be aborted.)</p>
<p class="startli">As the Finished message are message digests of the complete handshake (with a total of 192 bits for TLS 1.0 and more for SSL 3.0), they can be used for external authentication procedures when the authentication provided by SSL/TLS is not desired or is not enough.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Enhanced support for Alpha Linux is added. Now ./config checks if the host supports BWX extension and if Compaq C is present on the $PATH. Just exploiting of the BWX extension results in 20-30% performance kick for some algorithms, e.g. DES and RC4 to mention a couple. Compaq C in turn generates ~20% faster code for MD5 and SHA1.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Andy Polyakov</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add support for MS "fast SGC". This is arguably a violation of the SSL3/TLS protocol. Netscape SGC does two handshakes: the first with weak crypto and after checking the certificate is SGC a second one with strong crypto. MS SGC stops the first handshake after receiving the server certificate message and sends a second client hello. Since a server will typically do all the time consuming operations before expecting any further messages from the client (server key exchange is the most expensive) there is little difference between the two.</p>
<p class="startli">To get OpenSSL to support MS SGC we have to permit a second client hello message after we have sent server done. In addition we have to reset the MAC if we do get this second client hello.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a function 'd2i_AutoPrivateKey()' this will automatically decide if a DER encoded private key is RSA or DSA traditional format. Changed d2i_PrivateKey_bio() to use it. This is only needed for the "traditional" format DER encoded private key. Newer code should use PKCS#8 format which has the key type encoded in the ASN1 structure. Added DER private key support to pkcs8 application.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">SSL 3/TLS 1 servers now don't request certificates when an anonymous ciphersuites has been selected (as required by the SSL 3/TLS 1 specifications). Exception: When SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT is set, we interpret this as a request to violate the specification (the worst that can happen is a handshake failure, and 'correct' behaviour would result in a handshake failure anyway).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">In SSL_CTX_add_session, take into account that there might be multiple SSL_SESSION structures with the same session ID (e.g. when two threads concurrently obtain them from an external cache). The internal cache can handle only one SSL_SESSION with a given ID, so if there's a conflict, we now throw out the old one to achieve consistency.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Bodo Moeller</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add OIDs for idea and blowfish in CBC mode. This will allow both to be used in PKCS#5 v2.0 and S/MIME. Also add checking to some routines that use cipher OIDs: some ciphers do not have OIDs defined and so they cannot be used for S/MIME and PKCS#5 v2.0 for example.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Simplify the trust setting structure and code. Now we just have two sequences of OIDs for trusted and rejected settings. These will typically have values the same as the extended key usage extension and any application specific purposes.</p>
<p class="startli">The trust checking code now has a default behaviour: it will just check for an object with the same NID as the passed id. Functions can be provided to override either the default behaviour or the behaviour for a given id. SSL client, server and email already have functions in place for compatibility: they check the NID and also return "trusted" if the certificate is self signed.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add d2i,i2d bio/fp functions for PrivateKey: these convert the traditional format into an EVP_PKEY structure.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a password callback function PEM_cb() which either prompts for a password if usr_data is NULL or otherwise assumes it is a null terminated password. Allow passwords to be passed on command line environment or config files in a few more utilities.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a bunch of DER and PEM functions to handle PKCS#8 format private keys. Add some short names for PKCS#8 PBE algorithms and allow them to be specified on the command line for the pkcs8 and pkcs12 utilities. Update documentation.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Rebuild of the memory allocation routines used by OpenSSL code and possibly others as well. The purpose is to make an interface that provide hooks so anyone can build a separate set of allocation and deallocation routines to be used by OpenSSL, for example memory pool implementations, or something else, which was previously hard since Malloc(), Realloc() and Free() were defined as macros having the values malloc, realloc and free, respectively (except for Win32 compilations). The same is provided for memory debugging code. OpenSSL already comes with functionality to find memory leaks, but this gives people a chance to debug other memory problems.</p>
<p class="startli">With these changes, a new set of functions and macros have appeared:</p>
<p class="startli">CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_functions() [F] CRYPTO_get_mem_debug_functions() [F] CRYPTO_dbg_set_options() [F] CRYPTO_dbg_get_options() [F] CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init() [M]</p>
<p class="startli">The memory debug functions are NULL by default, unless the library is compiled with CRYPTO_MDEBUG or friends is defined. If someone wants to debug memory anyway, CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init() (which gives the standard debugging functions that come with OpenSSL) or CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_functions() (tells OpenSSL to use functions provided by the library user) must be used. When the standard debugging functions are used, CRYPTO_dbg_set_options can be used to request additional information: CRYPTO_dbg_set_options(V_CYRPTO_MDEBUG_xxx) corresponds to setting the CRYPTO_MDEBUG_xxx macro when compiling the library.</p>
<p class="startli">Also, things like CRYPTO_set_mem_functions will always give the expected result (the new set of functions is used for allocation and deallocation) at all times, regardless of platform and compiler options.</p>
<p class="startli">To finish it up, some functions that were never use in any other way than through macros have a new API and new semantic:</p>
<p class="startli">CRYPTO_dbg_malloc() CRYPTO_dbg_realloc() CRYPTO_dbg_free()</p>

This provides a simple S/MIME API on top of the PKCS#7 code, a MIME parser (with enough functionality to handle multipart/signed properly) and a utility called 'smime' to call all this stuff.

<li><p class="startli">Add variants des_set_key_checked and des_set_key_unchecked of des_set_key (aka des_key_sched). Global variable des_check_key decides which of these is called by des_set_key; this way des_check_key behaves as it always did, but applications and the library itself, which was buggy for des_check_key == 1, have a cleaner way to pick the version they need.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Modify X509_TRUST and X509_PURPOSE so it also uses a static and dynamic mix. In both cases the ids can be used as an index into the table. Also modified the X509_TRUST_add() and X509_PURPOSE_add() functions so they accept a list of the field values and the application doesn't need to directly manipulate the X509_TRUST structure.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>

<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Modify the way the V3 extension code looks up extensions. This now works in a similar way to the object code: we have some "standard" extensions in a static table which is searched with OBJ_bsearch() and the application can add dynamic ones if needed. The file crypto/x509v3/ext_dat.h now has the info: this file needs to be updated whenever a new extension is added to the core code and kept in ext_nid order. There is a simple program 'tabtest.c' which checks this. New extensions are not added too often so this file can readily be maintained manually.</p>
<p class="startli">There are two big advantages in doing things this way. The extensions can be looked up immediately and no longer need to be "added" using X509V3_add_standard_extensions(): this function now does nothing. Side note: I get <em>lots</em> of email saying the extension code doesn't work because people forget to call this function. Also no dynamic allocation is done unless new extensions are added: so if we don't add custom extensions there is no need to call X509V3_EXT_cleanup().</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fixes and enhancements to the 'x509' utility. It allowed a message digest to be passed on the command line but it only used this parameter when signing a certificate. Modified so all relevant operations are affected by the digest parameter including the -fingerprint and -x509toreq options. Also -x509toreq choked if a DSA key was used because it didn't fix the digest.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Initial certificate chain verify code. Currently tests the untrusted certificates for consistency with the verify purpose (which is set when the X509_STORE_CTX structure is set up) and checks the pathlength.</p>
<p class="startli">There is a NO_CHAIN_VERIFY compilation option to keep the old behaviour: this is because it will reject chains with invalid extensions whereas every previous version of OpenSSL and SSLeay made no checks at all.</p>
<p class="startli">Trust code: checks the root CA for the relevant trust settings. Trust settings have an initial value consistent with the verify purpose: e.g. if the verify purpose is for SSL client use it expects the CA to be trusted for SSL client use. However the default value can be changed to permit custom trust settings: one example of this would be to only trust certificates from a specific "secure" set of CAs.</p>
<p class="startli">Also added X509_STORE_CTX_new() and X509_STORE_CTX_free() functions which should be used for version portability: especially since the verify structure is likely to change more often now.</p>
<p class="startli">SSL integration. Add purpose and trust to SSL_CTX and SSL and functions to set them. If not set then assume SSL clients will verify SSL servers and vice versa.</p>
<p class="startli">Two new options to the verify program: -untrusted allows a set of untrusted certificates to be passed in and -purpose which sets the intended purpose of the certificate. If a purpose is set then the new chain verify code is used to check extension consistency.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>

<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Modify RSA and DSA PEM read routines to transparently handle PKCS#8 format private keys. New *_PUBKEY_* functions that handle public keys in a format compatible with certificate SubjectPublicKeyInfo structures. Unfortunately there were already functions called *_PublicKey_* which used various odd formats so these are retained for compatibility: however the DSA variants were never in a public release so they have been deleted. Changed dsa/rsa utilities to handle the new format: note no releases ever handled public keys so we should be OK.</p>
<p class="startli">The primary motivation for this change is to avoid the same fiasco that dogs private keys: there are several incompatible private key formats some of which are standard and some OpenSSL specific and require various evil hacks to allow partial transparent handling and even then it doesn't work with DER formats. Given the option anything other than PKCS#8 should be dumped: but the other formats have to stay in the name of compatibility.</p>
<p class="startli">With public keys and the benefit of hindsight one standard format is used which works with EVP_PKEY, RSA or DSA structures: though it clearly returns an error if you try to read the wrong kind of key.</p>
<p class="startli">Added a -pubkey option to the 'x509' utility to output the public key. Also rename the <code>EVP_PKEY_get_*()</code> to <code>EVP_PKEY_rget_*()</code> (renamed to <code>EVP_PKEY_get1_*()</code> in the OpenSSL 0.9.5 release) and add <code>EVP_PKEY_rset_*()</code> functions (renamed to <code>EVP_PKEY_set1_*()</code>) that do the same as the <code>EVP_PKEY_assign_*()</code> except they up the reference count of the added key (they don't "swallow" the supplied key).</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Fixes to crypto/x509/by_file.c the code to read in certificates and CRLs would fail if the file contained no certificates or no CRLs: added a new function to read in both types and return the number read: this means that if none are read it will be an error. The DER versions of the certificate and CRL reader would always fail because it isn't possible to mix certificates and CRLs in DER format without choking one or the other routine. Changed this to just read a certificate: this is the best we can do. Also modified the code in <code>apps/verify.c</code> to take notice of return codes: it was previously attempting to read in certificates from NULL pointers and ignoring any errors: this is one reason why the cert and CRL reader seemed to work. It doesn't check return codes from the default certificate routines: these may well fail if the certificates aren't installed.</p>

X509_verify has been modified to it will now verify a self signed certificate if <em>exactly</em> the same certificate appears in the store: it was previously impossible to trust a single self signed certificate. This means that: openssl verify ss.pem now gives a warning about a self signed certificate but openssl verify -CAfile ss.pem ss.pem is OK.</p>

<li><p class="startli">For servers, store verify_result in SSL_SESSION data structure (and add it to external session representation). This is needed when client certificate verifications fails, but an application-provided verification callback (set by SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback) allows accepting the session anyway (i.e. leaves x509_store_ctx-&gt;error != X509_V_OK but returns 1): When the session is reused, we have to set ssl-&gt;verify_result to the appropriate error code to avoid security holes.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Extensive changes to support certificate auxiliary information. This involves the use of X509_CERT_AUX structure and X509_AUX functions. An X509_AUX function such as PEM_read_X509_AUX() can still read in a certificate file in the usual way but it will also read in any additional "auxiliary information". By doing things this way a fair degree of compatibility can be retained: existing certificates can have this information added using the new 'x509' options.</p>
<p class="startli">Current auxiliary information includes an "alias" and some trust settings. The trust settings will ultimately be used in enhanced certificate chain verification routines: currently a certificate can only be trusted if it is self signed and then it is trusted for all purposes.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fix assembler for Alpha (tested only on DEC OSF not Linux or <code>*BSD</code>). The problem was that one of the replacement routines had not been working since SSLeay releases. For now the offending routine has been replaced with non-optimised assembler.

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Hack to fix PKCS#7 decryption when used with some unorthodox RC2 handling. Most clients have the effective key size in bits equal to the key length in bits: so a 40 bit RC2 key uses a 40 bit (5 byte) key. A few however don't do this and instead use the size of the decrypted key to determine the RC2 key length and the AlgorithmIdentifier to determine the effective key length. In this case the effective key length can still be 40 bits but the key length can be 168 bits for example. This is fixed by manually forcing an RC2 key into the EVP_PKEY structure because the EVP code can't currently handle unusual RC2 key sizes: it always assumes the key length and effective key length are equal.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a bunch of functions that should simplify the creation of X509_NAME structures. Now you should be able to do: X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt(nm, "CN", MBSTRING_ASC, "Steve", -1, -1, 0); and have it automatically work out the correct field type and fill in the structures. The more adventurous can try: X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt(nm, field, MBSTRING_UTF8, str, -1, -1, 0); and it will (hopefully) work out the correct multibyte encoding.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change the 'req' utility to use the new field handling and multibyte copy routines. Before the DN field creation was handled in an ad hoc way in req, ca, and x509 which was rather broken and didn't support BMPStrings or UTF8Strings. Since some software doesn't implement BMPStrings or UTF8Strings yet, they can be enabled using the config file using the dirstring_type option. See the new comment in the default openssl.cnf for more info.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Fix for base64 decode bug. When a base64 bio reads only one line of data and it contains EOF it will end up returning an error. This is caused by input 46 bytes long. The cause is due to the way base64 BIOs find the start of base64 encoded data. They do this by trying a trial decode on each line until they find one that works. When they do a flag is set and it starts again knowing it can pass all the data directly through the decoder. Unfortunately it doesn't reset the context it uses. This means that if EOF is reached an attempt is made to pass two EOFs through the context and this causes the resulting error. This can also cause other problems as well. As is usual with these problems it takes <em>ages</em> to find and the fix is trivial: move one line.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Ugly workaround to get s_client and s_server working under Windows. The old code wouldn't work because it needed to select() on sockets and the tty (for keypresses and to see if data could be written). Win32 only supports select() on sockets so we select() with a 1s timeout on the sockets and then see if any characters are waiting to be read, if none are present then we retry, we also assume we can always write data to the tty. This isn't nice because the code then blocks until we've received a complete line of data and it is effectively polling the keyboard at 1s intervals: however it's quite a bit better than not working at all :-) A dedicated Windows application might handle this with an event loop for example.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Enhance RSA_METHOD structure. Now there are two extra methods, rsa_sign and rsa_verify. When the RSA_FLAGS_SIGN_VER option is set these functions will be called when RSA_sign() and RSA_verify() are used. This is useful if rsa_pub_dec() and rsa_priv_enc() equivalents are not available. For this to work properly RSA_public_decrypt() and RSA_private_encrypt() should <em>not</em> be used: RSA_sign() and RSA_verify() must be used instead. This necessitated the support of an extra signature type NID_md5_sha1 for SSL signatures and modifications to the SSL library to use it instead of calling RSA_public_decrypt() and RSA_private_encrypt().</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add new -verify -CAfile and -CApath options to the crl program, these will lookup a CRL issuers certificate and verify the signature in a similar way to the verify program. Tidy up the crl program so it no longer accesses structures directly. Make the ASN1 CRL parsing a bit less strict.

<li><p class="startli">Initial support for DH_METHOD. Again based on RSA_METHOD. Also added a few extra parameters to the DH structure: these will be useful if for example we want the value of 'q' or implement X9.42 DH.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Initial support for DSA_METHOD. This is based on the RSA_METHOD and provides hooks that allow the default DSA functions or functions on a "per key" basis to be replaced.

Also added low-level modexp hooks and CRYPTO_EX structure and associated functions.</p>
<p class="startli"><em>Steve Henson</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add a new flag to memory BIOs, BIO_FLAG_MEM_RDONLY. This marks the BIO as "read only": it can't be written to and the buffer it points to will not be freed. Reading from a read only BIO is much more efficient than a normal memory BIO. This was added because there are several times when an area of memory needs to be read from a BIO. The previous method was to create a memory BIO and write the data to it, this results in two copies of the data and an O(n^2) reading algorithm. There is a new function BIO_new_mem_buf() which creates a read only memory BIO from an area of memory. Also modified the PKCS#7 routines to use read only memory BIOs.</p>

<p class="startli">For 1024-bit p, DSA_generate_parameters followed by DSA_dup_DH is much faster than DH_generate_parameters (which creates parameters where <code>p = 2*q + 1</code>), and also the smaller q makes DH computations much more efficient (160-bit exponentiation instead of 1024-bit exponentiation); so this provides a convenient way to support DHE ciphersuites in SSL/TLS servers (see ssl/ssltest.c). It is of utter importance to use SSL_CTX_set_options(s_ctx, SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE); or SSL_set_options(s_ctx, SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE); when such DH parameters are used, because otherwise small subgroup attacks may become possible!</p>

In the case of hardware keys for example no private key components need be present and it might store extra data in the RSA structure, which cannot be accessed from bn_mod_exp.

<p class="startli">It was supposed to omit the parameters when they matched the signing key: the verifying software was then supposed to automatically use the CA's parameters if they were absent from the end user certificate.</p>
<p class="startli">Omitting parameters is no longer recommended. The test was also the wrong way round! This was probably due to unusual behaviour in EVP_cmp_parameters() which returns 1 if the parameters match. This meant that parameters were omitted when they <em>didn't</em> match and the certificate was useless. Certificates signed with 'ca' didn't have this bug.</p>

The library internally uses CRYPTO_mem_ctrl(CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_DISABLE) aka MemCheck_off(), CRYPTO_mem_ctrl(CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_ENABLE) aka MemCheck_on() to disable memory-checking temporarily.</p>

This was true for the PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#12 PBE algorithms but doesn't apply to PKCS#5 v2.0 where it can be something else. Now the 'parameter' field of the AlgorithmIdentifier is passed to the underlying key generation function so it must do its own ASN1 parsing. This has also changed the EVP_PBE_CipherInit() function which now has a 'parameter' argument instead of literal salt and iteration count values and the function EVP_PBE_ALGOR_CipherInit() has been deleted.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">New functions sk_num, sk_value and sk_set to replace the previous macros. These are required because of the typesafe stack would otherwise break existing code. If old code used a structure member which used to be STACK and is now STACK_OF (for example cert in a PKCS7_SIGNED structure) with sk_num or sk_value it would produce an error because the num, data members are not present in STACK_OF. Now it just produces a warning. sk_set replaces the old method of assigning a value to sk_value (e.g. sk_value(x, i) = y) which the library used in a few cases. Any code that does this will no longer work (and should use sk_set instead) but this could be regarded as a "questionable" behaviour anyway.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Change type of various DES function arguments from des_cblock (which means, in function argument declarations, pointer to char) to des_cblock * (meaning pointer to array with 8 char elements), which allows the compiler to do more typechecking; it was like that back in SSLeay, but with lots of ugly casts.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Make SSL library a little more fool-proof by not requiring any longer that <code>SSL_set_{accept,connect}_state</code> be called before <code>SSL_{accept,connect}</code> may be used (<code>SSL_set_..._state</code> is omitted in many applications because usually everything <em>appeared</em> to work as intended anyway &ndash; now it really works as intended).</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli">Create a duplicate of the SSL_CTX's CERT in SSL_new instead of copying pointers. The <a class="el" href="structcert__st.html">cert_st</a> handling is changed by this in various ways (and thus what used to be known as ctx-&gt;default_cert is now called ctx-&gt;cert, since we don't resort to <code>s-&gt;ctx-&gt;[default_]cert</code> any longer when s-&gt;cert does not give us what we need). ssl_cert_instantiate becomes obsolete by this change. As soon as we've got the new code right (possibly it already is?), we have solved a couple of bugs of the earlier code where s-&gt;cert was used as if it could not have been shared with other SSL structures.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that using the SSL API in certain dirty ways now will result in different behaviour than observed with earlier library versions: Changing settings for an <code>SSL_CTX *ctx</code> after having done s = SSL_new(ctx) does not influence s as it used to.</p>
<p class="startli">In order to clean up things more thoroughly, inside SSL_SESSION we don't use CERT any longer, but a new structure SESS_CERT that holds per-session data (if available); currently, this is the peer's certificate chain and, for clients, the server's certificate and temporary key. CERT holds only those values that can have meaningful defaults in an SSL_CTX.</p>

The old 'ASN1 error code embedded in a comment' is no longer necessary and it doesn't use .err files which have now been deleted.

<li><p class="startli">Add a useful kludge to allow package maintainers to specify compiler and other platforms details on the command line without having to patch the Configure script every time: One now can use <code>perl Configure &lt;id&gt;:&lt;details&gt;</code>, i.e. platform ids are allowed to have details appended to them (separated by colons). This is treated as there would be a static pre-configured entry in Configure's table under key <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> with value <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>perl Configure &lt;id&gt;</code> is called. So, when you want to perform a quick test-compile under FreeBSD 3.1 with pgcc and without assembler stuff you can use <code>perl Configure "FreeBSD-elf:pgcc:-O6:::"</code> now, which overrides the FreeBSD-elf entry on-the-fly.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Add a bunch of SSL_xxx() functions for configuring the temporary RSA and DH private keys and/or callback functions which directly correspond to their SSL_CTX_xxx() counterparts but work on a per-connection basis. This is needed for applications which have to configure certificates on a per-connection basis (e.g. Apache+mod_ssl) instead of a per-context basis (e.g. s_server). For the RSA certificate situation is makes no difference, but for the DSA certificate situation this fixes the "no shared cipher" problem where the OpenSSL cipher selection procedure failed because the temporary keys were not overtaken from the context and the API provided no way to reconfigure them. The new functions now let applications reconfigure the stuff and they are in detail: SSL_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_set_tmp_rsa, SSL_set_tmp_dh, SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback. Additionally a new non-public-API function ssl_cert_instantiate() is used as a helper function and also to reduce code redundancy inside ssl_rsa.c.</p>
