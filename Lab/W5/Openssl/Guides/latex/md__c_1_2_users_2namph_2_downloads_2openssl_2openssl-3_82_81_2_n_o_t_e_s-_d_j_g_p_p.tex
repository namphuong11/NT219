Open\+SSL has been ported to DJGPP, a Unix look-\/alike 32-\/bit run-\/time environment for 16-\/bit DOS, but only with long filename support. If you wish to compile on native DOS with 8+3 filenames, you will have to tweak the installation yourself, including renaming files with illegal or duplicate names.

You should have a full DJGPP environment installed, including the latest versions of DJGPP, GCC, BINUTILS, BASH, etc. This package requires that PERL and the PERL module {\ttfamily Text\+::\+Template} also be installed (see \doxysectlink{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_n_o_t_e_s-_p_e_r_l}{NOTES-\/\+PERL.md}{0}).

All of these can be obtained from the usual DJGPP mirror sites or directly at \href{http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+delorie.\+com/pub/djgpp}}. For help on which files to download, see the DJGPP "{}\+ZIP PICKER"{} page at \href{http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/zip-picker.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+delorie.\+com/djgpp/zip-\/picker.\+html}}. You also need to have the WATT-\/32 networking package installed before you try to compile Open\+SSL. This can be obtained from \href{http://www.watt-32.net/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+watt-\/32.\+net/}}. The Makefile assumes that the WATT-\/32 code is in the directory specified by the environment variable WATT\+\_\+\+ROOT. If you have watt-\/32 in directory {\ttfamily watt32} under your main DJGPP directory, specify {\ttfamily WATT\+\_\+\+ROOT="{}/dev/env/\+DJDIR/watt32"{}}.

To compile Open\+SSL, start your BASH shell, then configure for DJGPP by running {\ttfamily ./\+Configure} with appropriate arguments\+:

./\+Configure no-\/threads --prefix=/dev/env/\+DJDIR DJGPP

And finally fire up {\ttfamily make}. You may run out of DPMI selectors when running in a DOS box under Windows. If so, just close the BASH shell, go back to Windows, and restart BASH. Then run {\ttfamily make} again.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_n_o_t_e_s-_d_j_g_p_p_autotoc_md869}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{RUN-\/\+TIME CAVEAT LECTOR}{RUN-\/\+TIME CAVEAT LECTOR}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_n_o_t_e_s-_d_j_g_p_p_autotoc_md869}
Quoting FAQ\+:

"{}\+Cryptographic software needs a source of unpredictable data to work    correctly.  Many open source operating systems provide a "{}randomness device"{} (\`{}/dev/urandom\`{} or \`{}/dev/random\`{}) that serves this purpose."{}

As of version 0.\+9.\+7f DJGPP port checks upon {\ttfamily /dev/urandom\$} for a 3rd party "{}randomness"{} DOS driver. One such driver, {\ttfamily NOISE.\+SYS}, can be obtained from \href{http://www.rahul.net/dkaufman/index.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+rahul.\+net/dkaufman/index.\+html}}.
