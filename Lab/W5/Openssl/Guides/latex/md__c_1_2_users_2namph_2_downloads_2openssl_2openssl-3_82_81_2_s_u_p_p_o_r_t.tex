See the \href{https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+openssl.\+org/support/contracts.\+html}} for details on how to obtain commercial technical support.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md968}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{If you have general questions about using Open\+SSL}{If you have general questions about using Open\+SSL}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md968}
In this case the \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-users}{\texttt{ openssl-\/users}} mailing list is the right place for you. The list is not only watched by the Open\+SSL team members, but also by many other Open\+SSL users. Here you will most likely get the answer to your questions. An overview over the mailing lists can be found below.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md969}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{If you think you found a Bug}{If you think you found a Bug}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md969}
{\itshape NOTE\+: this section assumes that you want to report it or figure it out and fix it. What\textquotesingle{}s written here is not to be taken as a recipe for how to get a working production installation}

If you have any problems with Open\+SSL then please take the following steps first\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Search the mailing lists and/or the Git\+Hub issues to find out whether the problem has already been reported.
\item Download the latest version from the repository to see if the problem has already been addressed.
\item Configure without assembler support ({\ttfamily no-\/asm}) and check whether the problem persists.
\item Remove compiler optimization flags.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please keep in mind\+: Just because something doesn\textquotesingle{}t work the way you expect does not mean it is necessarily a bug in Open\+SSL. If you are not sure, consider searching the mail archives and posting a question to the \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-users}{\texttt{ openssl-\/users}} mailing list first.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md970}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Open an Issue}{Open an Issue}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md970}
If you wish to report a bug, please open an \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/new/choose}{\texttt{ issue}} on Git\+Hub and include the following information\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open\+SSL version\+: output of {\ttfamily openssl version -\/a}
\item Configuration data\+: output of {\ttfamily perl configdata.\+pm -\/-\/dump}
\item OS Name, Version, Hardware platform
\item Compiler Details (name, version)
\item Application Details (name, version)
\item Problem Description (steps that will reproduce the problem, if known)
\item Stack Traceback (if the application dumps core)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Not only errors in the software, also errors in the documentation, in particular the manual pages, can be reported as issues.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md971}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Submit a Pull Request}{Submit a Pull Request}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md971}
The fastest way to get a bug fixed is to fix it yourself ;-\/). If you are experienced in programming and know how to fix the bug, you can open a pull request. The details are covered in the \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md}{\texttt{ Contributing}} section.

Don\textquotesingle{}t hesitate to open a pull request, even if it\textquotesingle{}s only a small change like a grammatical or typographical error in the documentation.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md972}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Mailing Lists}{Mailing Lists}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_s_u_p_p_o_r_t_autotoc_md972}
The Open\+SSL maintains a number of \href{https://www.openssl.org/community/mailinglists.html}{\texttt{ mailing lists}} for various purposes. The most important lists are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-users}{\texttt{ openssl-\/users}} for general questions about using the Open\+SSL software and discussions between Open\+SSL users.
\item \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-announce}{\texttt{ openssl-\/announce}} for official announcements to the Open\+SSL community.
\item \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-project}{\texttt{ openssl-\/project}} for discussion about the development roadmap and governance.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Only subscribers can post to \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-users}{\texttt{ openssl-\/users}} or \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-project}{\texttt{ openssl-\/project}}. The archives are made public, however. For more information, see the \mbox{[}mailing lists\mbox{]} page.

There was an \href{https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-dev}{\texttt{ openssl-\/dev}} list that has been discontinued since development is now taking place in the form of Git\+Hub pull requests. Although not active anymore, the searchable archive may still contain useful information.
