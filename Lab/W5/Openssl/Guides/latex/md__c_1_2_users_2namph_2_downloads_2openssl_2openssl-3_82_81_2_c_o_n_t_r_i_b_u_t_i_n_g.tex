Please visit our \href{https://www.openssl.org/community/getting-started.html>}{\texttt{ Getting Started}} page for other ideas about how to contribute.

Development is done on Git\+Hub in the \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl>}{\texttt{ openssl/openssl}} repository.

To request new a feature, ask a question, or report a bug, please open an \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues}{\texttt{ issue on Git\+Hub}}.

To submit a patch or implement a new feature, please open a \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pulls}{\texttt{ pull request on Git\+Hub}}. If you are thinking of making a large contribution, open an issue for it before starting work, to get comments from the community. Someone may be already working on the same thing, or there may be special reasons why a feature is not implemented.

To make it easier to review and accept your pull request, please follow these guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Anything other than a trivial contribution requires a \mbox{[}Contributor License Agreement\mbox{]} (CLA), giving us permission to use your code. If your contribution is too small to require a CLA (e.\+g., fixing a spelling mistake), then place the text "{}\`{}\+CLA\+: trivial\`{}"{} on a line by itself below the rest of your commit message separated by an empty line, like this\+:

\`{}\`{}\`{} One-\/line summary of trivial change

Optional main body of commit message. It might contain a sentence or two explaining the trivial change.

CLA\+: trivial \`{}\`{}\`{}

It is not sufficient to only place the text "{}\`{}\+CLA\+: trivial\`{}"{} in the Git\+Hub pull request description.

To amend a missing "{}\`{}\+CLA\+: trivial\`{}"{} line after submission, do the following\+:

{\ttfamily  git commit -\/-\/amend @section autotoc\+\_\+md180 add the line, save and quit the editor git push -\/f \mbox{[}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}repository\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \mbox{[}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}branch\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\mbox{]}\mbox{]} }
\item All source files should start with the following text (with appropriate comment characters at the start of each line and the year(s) updated)\+:

\`{}\`{}\`{} Copyright 20xx-\/20yy The Open\+SSL Project Authors. All Rights Reserved.

Licensed under the Apache License 2.\+0 (the "{}\+License"{}). You may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You can obtain a copy in the file LICENSE in the source distribution or at \href{https://www.openssl.org/source/license.html}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+openssl.\+org/source/license.\+html}} \`{}\`{}\`{}
\item Patches should be as current as possible; expect to have to rebase often. We do not accept merge commits, you will have to remove them (usually by rebasing) before it will be acceptable.
\item Code provided should follow our \href{https://www.openssl.org/policies/technical/coding-style.html}{\texttt{ coding style}} and compile without warnings. There is a \href{util/check-format.pl}{\texttt{ Perl tool}} that helps finding code formatting mistakes and other coding style nits. Where {\ttfamily gcc} or {\ttfamily clang} is available, you should use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/strict-\/warnings} {\ttfamily Configure} option. Open\+SSL compiles on many varied platforms\+: try to ensure you only use portable features. Clean builds via Git\+Hub Actions are required. They are started automatically whenever a PR is created or updated by committers.
\item When at all possible, code contributions should include tests. These can either be added to an existing test, or completely new. Please see \doxysectlink{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2test_2_r_e_a_d_m_e}{test/\+README.md}{0} for information on the test framework.
\item New features or changed functionality must include documentation. Please look at the {\ttfamily .pod} files in {\ttfamily doc/man\mbox{[}1357\mbox{]}} for examples of our style. Run {\ttfamily make doc-\/nits} to make sure that your documentation changes are clean.
\item For user visible changes (API changes, behaviour changes, ...), consider adding a note in \doxysectlink{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_s}{CHANGES.md}{0}. This could be a summarising description of the change, and could explain the grander details. Have a look through existing entries for inspiration. Please note that this is NOT simply a copy of git-\/log one-\/liners. Also note that security fixes get an entry in \doxysectlink{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_s}{CHANGES.md}{0}. This file helps users get more in-\/depth information of what comes with a specific release without having to sift through the higher noise ratio in git-\/log.
\item Guidelines how to integrate error output of new crypto library modules can be found in \doxysectlink{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2crypto_2err_2_r_e_a_d_m_e}{crypto/err/\+README.md}{0}.
