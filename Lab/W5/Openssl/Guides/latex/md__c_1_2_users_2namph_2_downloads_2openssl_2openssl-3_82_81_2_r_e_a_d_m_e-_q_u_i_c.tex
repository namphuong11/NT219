From Open\+SSL 3.\+2, Open\+SSL features support for making QUIC connections as a client.

Users interested in using the new QUIC functionality are encouraged to look at some of the following resources\+:

\item The \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/tree/master/doc/designs/ddd}{\texttt{ Demo-\/\+Driven Design (DDD)}} demos, which demonstrate the use of QUIC using simple examples. These can be \mbox{[}found in the source tree under {\ttfamily doc/designs/ddd}\mbox{]}.

QUIC is a state-\/of-\/the-\/art secure transport protocol carried over UDP. It can serve many of the use cases of SSL/\+TLS as well as those of DTLS.

QUIC delivers a number of advantages such as support for multiple streams of communication; it is the basis for HTTP/3 \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9114}{\texttt{ RFC 9114}}; fast connection initiation; and connection migration (enabling a connection to survive IP address changes). For a more complete description of what QUIC is and its advantages see the \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ossl-guide-quic-introduction.html}{\texttt{ QUIC Introduction}} in the \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ossl-guide-introduction.html}{\texttt{ Open\+SSL Guide}}.

There are many HTTP/3 implementations in C available. The use of one such HTTP/3 library with Open\+SSL QUIC is demonstrated via the \href{./demos/http3/}{\texttt{ demo found in {\ttfamily demos/http3}}}.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_r_e_a_d_m_e-_q_u_i_c_autotoc_md949}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How can I use Open\+SSL QUIC in my own application for a different protocol?}{How can I use Open\+SSL QUIC in my own application for a different protocol?}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_r_e_a_d_m_e-_q_u_i_c_autotoc_md949}
The \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ossl-guide-introduction.html}{\texttt{ Open\+SSL Guide}} provides introductory examples for how to make use of Open\+SSL QUIC.

The \href{https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/openssl-quic.html}{\texttt{ openssl-\/quic(7) manual page}} and the \href{https://github.com/openssl/openssl/tree/master/doc/designs/ddd}{\texttt{ Demo-\/\+Driven Design (DDD)}} demos may also be helpful to illustrate the changes needed if you are trying to adapt an existing application.\hypertarget{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_r_e_a_d_m_e-_q_u_i_c_autotoc_md950}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How can I test QUIC using {\ttfamily openssl s\+\_\+client}?}{How can I test QUIC using {\ttfamily openssl s\+\_\+client}?}}\label{md__c_1_2_users_2namph_2_downloads_2openssl_2openssl-3_82_81_2_r_e_a_d_m_e-_q_u_i_c_autotoc_md950}
There is basic support for single-\/stream QUIC using {\ttfamily openssl s\+\_\+client}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ openssl\ s\_client\ -\/quic\ -\/alpn\ myalpn\ -\/connect\ host:port}

\end{DoxyCode}


In the above example replace {\ttfamily host} with the hostname of the server (e.\+g. {\ttfamily www.\+example.\+com}) and {\ttfamily port} with the port for the server (e.\+g. {\ttfamily 443}). Replace {\ttfamily myalpn} with the Application Layer Protocol to use (e.\+g.{\ttfamily h3} represents HTTP/3). IANA maintains a standard list of \href{https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml\#alpn-protocol-ids}{\texttt{ ALPN ids}} that can be used.

This example connects to a QUIC server and opens a single bidirectional stream. Data can be passed via stdin/stdout as usual. This allows test usage of QUIC using simple TCP/\+TLS-\/like usage. Note that Open\+SSL has no direct support for HTTP/3 so connecting to an HTTP/3 server should be possible but sending an HTTP/3 request or receiving any response data is not.
