This directory contains the algorithm life-\/cycle diagram sources.

The canonical life-\/cycles are in the spreadsheet.

The various .dot files are graph descriptions for the \href{https://www.graphviz.org/}{\texttt{ Graph\+Viz}} tool. These omit edges and should be used for guidance only.

To generate the rendered images, you need to install the following packages\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo apt install graphviz cpanminus
sudo cpanm Graph::Easy
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Running {\ttfamily make} will produce a number of {\ttfamily .txt} and {\ttfamily .png} files. These are the rendered {\ttfamily .dot} files. The {\ttfamily .txt} files require additional editing before they can be added to the manual pages in {\ttfamily internal/man7/life\+\_\+cycle-\/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.pod}.
